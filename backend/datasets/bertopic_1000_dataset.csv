"OK, I love the app, it's great, but the notifications just doesn't work, they are broken, and it's the main feature I'm looking for, fix it in order to give you the five starts"
Way over priced for what it does. Not worth it!
"So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars"
Some daily tasks just disappear a minute after I tick them. This bug is affecting me for about a week now and I'm already tired of it.
Excellent replacement for Wunderlist! A nice feature would be to automatically delete completed tasks from certain lists...or an option to print only the active list. On my iPad I nearly hit print with 400 pages of completed tasks! Other than that it's perfect.
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first."
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep
I love the concept & look of this mobile app & the desktop version. I wish I could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks. You also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into Artful Agenda. You have to add it to your Google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to Artful Agenda. I've paid for the year subscription & I'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or I won't be renewing.
This app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save
"Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts"
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
"I don't know why but this app doesn't function well on my phone. I have enabled all the settings but whenever I try to open this app it says ""forest"" keeps stopping. I love this app, but I want a way out of this problem."
The tutorial looks simple and a good layout but when I make an entry 9 out of 10 times it disappears and I need to re-enter it. Half the time dosent work
Good one
this app sucks
"Calendar has a lot of good features but half the time my reminders don't go off so I miss them. Paid for the full version but it still didn't help. All of my Friday reminders finally chimed on Sunday, kinda pointless!!"
Bom
I'd rather have continous ads than a payed time subscription. Honestly the subscription seems pretty shady for somethng you can easily do yourself... $3.69 for a month subscription and $36 bucks for a yearly subscription? Seriously? Why not just pay a premium one-time payment costing $10? Pathetic.
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.
shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly. otherwise all around good app.
The app really nice.....i request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders
"Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet."
The free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders... Kind of pointless. I'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium. The layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives. I would have considered buying if there was a one-time payment model.
"Ive used this app a couple times now, only uninstalling because school ended, but this app is amazing when it comes down to it. It encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others. Plus, it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with/rpg game like elements."
"Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for...."
"I think it's a great app, and a lot of fun. I had some trouble figuring things out at first, but everything works. The only complaint I would have is the cost... It would be nice to have some of the features, but they are too expensive."
Everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
This app stops working everytime I install it. I have already taken its subscription but now everytime I open it crashes. I have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isn't solved.
"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all."
"Really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. However, I did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days. Everything else you can edit,..time, date, category, but wanted to change my days and I had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5☆s"
"This app really draws my attention. Forest not only sends out meaningful messages (protect the green environment and save the future), but it is also a friendly reminder for me of staying focused on study and work, instead of being distracted."
"This app is brilliant! Clean, simple, and ultimately customizable. I've been wanting something like this for a while!"
"I love the app but recently the widgets have been glitching, they go blank or sometimes do respond when I click a checkbox."
Laggy.
Think its great but keeps going black and crashing all the time!
"This has everything I'm looking for from a UI perspective except one key thing: the ability to invite someone else to add/complete list items with you. It's the function Wunderlist fulfilled for us and I've been looking for a replacement ever since they were bought by MS. Add it, and it will be the dream list app I want!"
Notification is not of up to my expectation. Need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it... Besides that.. The way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect. I do love to continue using it if they update the notification part.
Nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app
loving it so far! keeps me motivated :)
"This app is so cool! It's geared towards complete configuration from the user, so give your goals the time they deserve and map it out. Once you get through learning the app, it will be an awesome tool for your future development!"
I've been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird. I don't receive reminders anymore and it's completely a waste of time to set reminders! Not very reliable right now
"The program is very good on my old phone(galaxy note 4), but notifications don't work on the new one(redmi note 8 pro). I hope you will fix them. Thanks"
"I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys."
"I very rarely leave reviews, but I have to say this is the best ""to do"" app I've ever used in my life. I've even tried all the popular ones and they didn't work for me like this one does. The notifications are amazing and I love that I can snooze them."
Good interface and design. But the sharing capabilities were riddled with issues. The app became almost unusable if you tried to share anything
Nice one
Very simple setup and gives you an idea of where you have time in your daily schedule.
"Came from Wunderlist and, to no surprise, Microsoft has managed to cause issues. My wife and I create ""tasks"" as shopping lists and they take quite a bit longer to sync than they used to if they even sync at all."
"I signed up for the pro: $30/ year is on the bordreline for me, but i feel it is worth it if it can make me even 15% more organized or disciplibed. It has some very good features and flexibility: 1) Kanban view of projects sold me; 2) a nice habit maker capability, 3) plan my day feature where you go through the tasks of the day and either keep them or postpone them."
Super Kalender App
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it"
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub."
"I have the same recurring tasks to do every day. I need a to-do-list reminder to buzz me when it's time. The problem with this app, is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day, giving me different times the next day! That is an annoying fail! Screw it, I'm going elsewhere. if I find a better app, I'll let you guys know. UPDATE : Suggestion did not work, and I found an app, that does not drift. I have moved on."
The app is only syncing my all-day events. All other events are not displaying.
Everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake .....please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.
"Of all the check list apps I've tried out, this one is the best organized, and it's customizable without being overly complicated."
"The app is great for organizing and planning, however the constantly crashing gets old really fast. Please fix this. Otherwise the app would be perfect!"
"Not a single event, appointment, meeting, etc...is showing up. going to uninstall after rating."
Nice app. it's just I feel their is always space for improvement.
"I love everything about this app, except for how it handles snoozing repeat tasks. It's easy to use and has a lot of configuration, something a lot of other apps save for the premium version. Unfortunately, I find it unusable due to how snoozing repeat tasks then alters the date/time for all future occurrences, making it difficult to manage these tasks when I just want to snooze it this one time. If this was changed I would give 5 stars and upgrade to premium as the app is otherwise perfect."
Pretty good calendar app. I like the layout of the Samsung calendar app a little better but this one has more features.
Best app to focus and study
"It's actually good but then stopped working effectively since a week ... suddenly it stops and I couldn't open it...so, had to uninstall and install many a times, I also lost all my productivity due to it's sudden shutdown...mine is a pro version too..this is so bad and testing our patience.. please fix the issue.! Thankyou."
Love the app only had for 2 days 👍
Great app stopping me from procrastinating... Actually getting things done 👍
"The app is really good, but after some time it keeps stopping! I reinstalled it two times and the third time also, the problem persists. I was forced to uninstall it finally."
"I was going to give 4 stars, but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to Google play if you said five stars, so I lowered it to 2 stars."
"Great, but have some issues with the tasks list widget. No way I can complete a task on it without its disappearing"
Lack of personal themes. Not such pleasant view as it was in Wunderlist.
The most recent update just made it harder to move times around.
Just downloaded the app better review later on
"Updates made that are not fully tested. They need to add option to revert back to the olddd verison. that was simple to use, but most importantly it worked."
Hey i was very glad to use calendar 30 until now. I can not edit anything ... If i want to delete something is reappear every time. I can't move or delete. If is not working i want my money back. I will change the review if you solve this problem. Edit :I will edit the review after you ll solve this problem. I send it an email also.
Good.
Didn't make any sense to me. I started using this app and attempted to make a sceduale but couldn't figure it out.
"There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is."
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad
App s not opening...its vry hard to uninstal .. and instal again..plz fix tis prblm..otherwise app s too gud...
Ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
"Just I love it. I don't know this app. Once I open YouTube and see what is the best apps for student. And it tells 10 apps. But I can try only this app. So it will be very helpful, greatful, joyful and totally it suits me. It is very helpful for all. Your's, Deepika"
"I'm loving the User Interface of the app. Easy to use, simplified widget display, I don't think I even need the pro version. Perfect. Completely value adding."
"Extremely easy to use. Only thing I'm having troubles with is I have an event that I set for 15mins a week, everytime I try and tap that its comoleted it asks me to set the new rule instead of just marking complete."
No notification of Habit tracks
"Really beneficial, it allows me to follow my routines efficiently"
Lots of In-app purchases ... Not worth the time .
My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options 😊
Worst app ever!!! During the import from Wonderlist it removed all of my data. Leave it to MS to screw up a great app.
"Really pretty good app; but two problems! 1. Sometimes repeat weekly reminders don't work at all, especially if you haven't ticked it the previous week! 2. Please allow multiple reminders for one event! Thanks, it's really promising and useful otherwise!"
Good
Good for those who read offline but not for those who have online studying platform.
"NEED MORE ×.WITH APP, SO FAR SOGOOD"
"Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine."
"This application is very helpful for me. Thanks ""Any.do"" for everything to remember me."
This app is crashing again and again and again. I've pro version still it keeps crashing every 2nd day. Please fix this it's damn irritating every 2nd day to get a fresh installation.
"I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar"
"There is too much WHITE everywhere. what happened to assigning colors to folders? Add some more theme colors like purple please. The latest update added color to the calendar widget for events, can you please give us the option to choose the colors? Also please bring back the old completion sound. Lowered rating because your Android Wear app hasn't been updated since 2015. Please fix to work with 2.0. I really love this app but may have to move on if it won't work on my watch."
Lately from past two days I am facing difficulty using widget. Getting an error 'task list not found' whenever I strike off a task. Please look into it ASAP.
It allows me to leave the app. I have a Techno phone. How do i fix this? Sleeptown works perfectly though.
Probably the best productivity app available for FREE! The app itself is easy to use and it's really easy to make a task/routine. Highly recommended.
"Happy with the App...but personally I had two issues which are if addressed, may provide sort of convienience to the users. 1. If any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that I felt inconvenient to write the task again. 2. If any task is being feeded and there also undo/redo options are not available"
"Just installed this yesterday. Loved it. Love the concept. Love the design. Too bad the free version can't have access to the calendar 😝 but otherwise, it's a great app. Am gonna give it a go for another few more weeks before deciding to commit to premium."
It was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars I'm losing dates appointments
it's a nice app. it make my life displined
Good
Been using this app for for years now and I really love it and help me organize stuff/schedules.
"in primo luogo, adoro... voglio dire, una lista che mi faccia giocare ed avanzare di livello come in un rpg... non posso fare altro che adorare tanterrimo in secondo luogo: probabilmente esiste un modo per impostare orari per le attività (lezioni, cose così), altrimenti non avrebbe senso poter impostare un allarme, ma... hem... io non ho idea di come si faccia (help me please) cosa numero tre: ho provato a cercarne una versione adattabile per pc e non sembra esserci... sarebbe bellissimo se ci fosse e (magari) fosse sincronizzabile ultima cosa e poi la pianto: esiste un modo per creare traguardi composti da più traguardi? mi piacerebbe avere un megaobbiettivo laurea composto dei vari esami... o campagne composte di varie sessioni..."
"i cannt acces my account anymore since their ""password reset"" feature does not work. tried on my iphone, android oreo, web version. i don't receive any email to reset my password."
The user interfaceis not good enough. It is not that much understandable
"I like it. However, I can't seem to get the notification sounds to work. They used to."
I input my appointments and it does not ring loud enough or pop up to let me know that i have an appt.  I have the paid version.  Am i doing something wrong.  IF my appt is at 11:00 do i have to input at 12:00 to get it to ring before 11:  screwy lewy. I will change my comments and rating once i get this resolved.
The new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect
"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees."
Such a great app. Helps to organize your day perfectly. Great features
"It's good but for some reason, it keeps switching around everything. And I can't seem to move them around, so I have to delete them and start again. A bit frustrating but has a great purpose."
New update causing app to freeze. Pls correct it immediately.
I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.
I like the way this app looks. Helps me feel I'm achieving things!
"It ok, gets boring after a while"
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!"
"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am."""
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭
"A novel approach to timekeeping that totally works. Effective and elegant. The best face for my smartwatch. BUT for me personally, it is always upside-down on my wrist. Can a feature be added to allow it to be rotated 180°??"
"This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions."
I'm basically lazy. This has helped me get myself into a routine somewhat. Works like a charm. And stares right into my face everytime I open (the widget) so I don't miss a thing. Great work. 👍
"So close to being my dream todo app. It claims to support Start Times but actually doesn't. You can record the start and due time, but you can't then filter a list to only show a task that has in fact started; i.e. what can I work on NOW. For me this makes start times nothing more than a tag, that I can't interact with, which totally defeats the point."
Having trouble syncing on new device; says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong.
"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!"
좋아요
"Before this, l used Wunderlist solely for my do listn I used Workflowy for ongoing notes and events throughout the years. I ike this app, but if you don't get everything done yesterday's then My Day iwhen you wake up the next day, My Day is blank. Imagine making to do list on a posted note and the next morning it was blank? That's not saving me time. Don't know why they didn't put that in when developing the app."
"wish It would link to my calendar so I can create, edit and complete in one location....that would make it 5 stars"
Used it for 1 day. Then forgot to even open it as got into new habit. It kept showing notifications and I kept ignoring it. Not much productive for me but app design is good.
Good app but you need to pay a subscription to use it fully. There isn't an option to pay for the app outright which is a shame
Crashes at start.
Not at all use ... Its not remainding with alarming then whats is the use of remainder app... Its only alarming while we open the app... Not usefull at all
"Very easy to use, good"
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited."
Alarm nahi he
Stop looking at users as cash cows. I will be uninstalling this and moving to a different app which is as good and does not nag. This is quite a good To Do app other than that it too often comes up with prompts to upgrade to the premium subscription-based version. Since when have customers disrespectfully/greedily been treated as cash cows. It used to be apps were$5 at most for a lifetime of use but now they are greedy and arrogant enough to want $5 or thereabouts per Month! I wud pay a one off
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great
It was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
No custom repeat frequency...
Not sure.
Good experience
"Once I tweaked it for GTD, this is by far the best app out there. Speedy, snappy features and performance in every platform, extremely flexible labels, categories, projects, whatever. Easy rescheduling, adding tasks in the moment and multiple ways to do almost everything . So slick."
"It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment."
"Very good. When I find myself lost in life (very often) , I swipe my trembling thumb over to Todoist, and am instantly guided back upon the path of righteous order. My day is immediately placed upon terms in which i can fully structure and understand and from which point, seize with a newfound confidence. That, or I reschedule my tasks to the next day. 10/10 I am better for it."
"Its good. The only thing that is missing is the time inclusion. Like at what time a particular task is planned. If that can be added, it would be perfect. It would be like a personal calendar and activity planner together. I hope that can be added."
"I really like how easy it is to use, that it displays your progress in a neat and easy-to-track way, and gives you options for how to measure your success (yes/no per day, #of days per week, days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat', etc). It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend."
"Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me."
"It's ok. So this is what Wunderlist became, it's pretty similar, it's intuitive but it's lost features that made it not a suitable replacement. Specially the ability to export list which include hyperlinks in the notes (or anything in the notes) and no (official) add on for a browser like chrome. Deal breakers for me, moved to TickTick. Still miss Wunderlist :("
"Firstly, thanks for your quick responses back. I appreciate it. Ok, so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app? Because there's no tutorial for that part. When I click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there's nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created."
"When you start to reschedule things, the interface is very awkward moving times around. For example, moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive"
"I can't seem to think it so I lose my calendar after 3 months and all my appointments. Is also ridiculous amount of pop-up ads.. it would be better if forwarding dates, this could be 1 step. Sometimes it is, rarely"
"I like this app👍but my routine won't work and notifications won't make 
sounds and not appear on screen..."
The app does what it says across devices. Would love a feature to add colours to the list to sort them out as per urgency. Another feature could be to give formatting options for text for additional notes within a set task.
"App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app."
"Automatically shows the reminder Snackbar when I open other apps without me setting it up, what kind of violation is this??? Stop bugging your users unsolicitedly. Uninstalled"
Alarm doesn't work fine
"I bought the premium version of this app and it doesn't work. The reminder does not function, which basically renders the app useless. I emailed the support team and I haven't gotten any response or acknowledgement of receipt. I want a refund. What a waste of my money"
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.
After the update whenever I try o buy a new kind of tree the app closes I liked the app before but now i have losed my interest in it😒😒😒😒😒 Please fix this bug..
"Am a timetune paid user , been using for more than a month. This looks like another User Interface for just reminders. Nothing more than this . An average application"
"It seems like a good app but I haven't found a way to enable a permanent notification for quick task adding. Is it only possible? EDIT: No, I mean a permanent notification that works like your widget, allowing to quickly add new tasks without opening the app. SplenDO and Any. Do have this feature for instance."
Can't understand how it works
"Best and cleanest scheduling app I've found by far. It has it all: multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals, visually effective tags, comments visible on table and notifications, widget, statistics, events, dark theme. All without adding unnecessary noise. Using it is extremely intuitive. Doesn't lock any significant features behind premium wall, instead they're just extras that are nice to have (which is a rarity). But one thing that's missing is the ability to copy events/activities."
This is most probably the best reminder app in android. I am using it for last couple of years after trying so many apps. I just love the widgets and the ad-less experience. I use it daily to manage my work. The reminder pop up is really helpful. Thank you developers.
Very easy to use. Have all I need
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.
"Very good job. A ""postpone"" option is needed. It's a priority I believe Also, would like option for completed habits to hide for the day, and option to edit categories names, icons and colours"
I wish there would be a widget on lockscreen
Seems pretty neat but i miss one feature thst is very important for me: be able to just hit start/stop for tasks thst needs to be done for at least x minutes per day. i dont check or remember time when i start doing something.
Good but have more levels
Great app
"Very user unfriendly with hardly any explanation regarding what the buttons do or the stats mean. Trying to edit tasks for each day will only let me invent new tasks, not pick from a list. Utterly confusing. Could have been so much easier."
"Seems good so far. I might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say I didn't like it or rate it now... EDIT: to reply to the response. There was only the option to review now or say I didn't like it. I would have picked review later if that was there. EDIT 2: Thanks for taking my suggestion on board, I will update this review and rating once I have used the app more 👍"
"The new video ad is really annoying, it pops out, and no way to close it unless you close the entire app. It really interrupt when you want to add a few appointments to the calendar."
"It does the job I wanted, that is to ring alarm at the set time. However I am unable to clear the timeline! That is old ones. Couldn't get much help from their help center"
This is the best app I have seen in this whole universe it has all the features everyone should download this app 😗😗😗😗😙😙😙😙
"Can be smarter, but good."
"Great, simple app. Notifications can be better; they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless."
Does not have a recurring task feature. Useless for me.
Ads that completely take over your phone and have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them.
My calendar doesn't show up
Very happy with this calendar. Have been using it for years. Thank you.
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked
Great Tool
Simple and practical
Love it
The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.
"Very effective. I would give 5 stars ,but writting space too little. Larger writting space will help much better."
"Used to be great, ads are now far too intrusive and unprofessional"
Felt more like i was wasting time instead of getting something done.
For anyone who wants to use this app: Devs stopped updating this in 2018. So they won't reply to your queries and/or issues. Look elsewhere...
Missing an important feature!!! They need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day. It is a must for someone who has ADHD. I would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature.
"Edit (since I can't seem to respond to your comment): I have the feeling the fullscreen apps appear more often than once every 18 hours, although I admittedly am not sure about this. But the x icon only appears after a timer has run out, which is partially why they're so annoying. I do understand the need for ads, and that a lot of work is put into the app, and I appreciate all your hard work on it ;)"
Useless without pro.
That's a great app
"Authors: Please stop associating every extension with this app. It's annoying this pops up when I try to open a jar file. [Edit] This means that excluding certain very popular file extensions (svg, pdf, jpg) when a file is opened from the files app, business calendar opens. This means if I try to open a Bz2 file, a AndrOffice file (odt) or a Jar file (jar). It's strange for me that Open Office files wouldn't open in AndrOffice but instead Business calendar opens instead."
"When you use the pomo timer, it automatically starts counting down when you hit what task you want yo be working on. There is no longer an icon where you can choose your white noise before starting the pomo and no way to pause the pomo once it starts so you can select your white noise. I would like to be able to select the task I'm working on, select what white noise I want, and then start the pomo; not everything automatically start."
Easy! Make your to-do list. Check it off or move it. What else do you want in a to-do app?
"EVERY service I attempted to connect (Gmail, Gtasks, google calendar,) timed out during setup (oops error). Been 2 days and still no reply from support. Device is Samsung S9 with Android 10."
"Cool concept but an app like this requires too much focus of its own which only pulls attention away from your intended project. Maybe it would be better with a more comprehensive tutorial but I doubt it. I prefer something straightforward, like Screen Time."
This app is very helpful especially for students. I can now focus on my stuff more efficiently and with real heart.
Would pay for this if there were even more additions and updates. Absolutely love it and wish they would develop it even further
"Worst Experience Ever. I signed out, & All of my Tasks list Gone.... Login bar doesn't even showing what email it was. And I don't remember my email. I was going to buy this App, but hate now. Don't have any way to backup my list."
"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect."
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.
A simple app that could not be more complicated to operate.
"I transferred from Wunderlist. I enjoy many features, especially being able to share it all with another person. They have fixed some of the comments I've seen like you can tell it to put a new item at the top of the list. Only problem I've seen is when I move a weekly item to a different day, it keeps the reminder on the day it was originally on."
"I love the overall concept, and, the diverse options for setup. Though, so many setting options are a little overwhelming to sort out. I've had the app for a few weeks and I am still trying tweak my layout ... visuals are everything for me. I believe, when originally setting up a few weeks ago, I was a bit annoyed to have spent time choosing colors for the widget to find out it is a premium feature (To Developer: plz be upfront on the premium feature options). I think once I get it really working for me it will be a fave app."
"There's a bug with the planning view, you can't see the title of the event. Other than that the app runs okay."
good
Love the app... But the reminder function is not working well . Otherwise app is awesome . Plz requested to fix it soon
It's not like the web site
"The app crashes quite often recently but when it works it's really useful to manage events and meetings, easy to use"
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know."
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?
"I'll like it more if I can the way I view this apps, difficult for me to type in landscape position"
Estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse.
I recently signed up and paid to upgrade to Business Calendar 2 Pro but am not sure how to activate. Need advice.
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse
"I'm disappointed, having lost my data twice because there is a serious lacuna in its program. When I delete a 'daily' item after completing it, it should go into the 'completed' list and its next scheduled occurrence immediately appear in the current list. But at times it doesn't happen like that, and if I've deleted it from the completed list even after some hours, it just disappears for ever. Seems that this action is server-dependent rather than being localized, and on the mercy of internet."
"Worked fine for months, now it doesn't track habits the way I set them. It treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how I have set it up. Going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app."
"Really great app ! Giving three star only because having problem to make routines! After adding five or six activities, it stops working. Can't add anymore ! Please notify me after fixing the issue."
Don't know how to use
"This is a great app, but i dun like it link to my calendar, because it will mess them up. Prefer if this is a standalone calendar, so that i can separate my schedule in this app, and other schedule in my calendar"
Works well and syncs well with the chosen calenders.
"After I purchased the pro version, all my previous tress were deleted. Contacted support. They told me to log out and for the past couple of days I have been unable to log back in. Unable to view friends list, sync, tags are not working properly,redeem gifts or plant trees with friends😑 the support team is also not helping me quite well. I have been emailing them and I am not getting clear instructions 👎 I am also unable to connect the intercom within the app."
Good one
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features."
Only deserve big zero. Because 1) I reinstalled this app 17 times in a week. No other app crashed this much times past 1 year in my phone. Your concept is awesome.. thats is why i installed this much times. But it needs a good developer....not just like todays...NOTE : Your 4.20.1 updation failed to solve this issue..
"I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right. Whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted. I did everything the helpers told me (clear cache, reinstall the app, restart phone) and nothing worked. Its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support."
"App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing"
"I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved"
"The widgets keep disappearing from my home screen Response to dev: I use both the ""BC2 - Day Pro"" and the ""BC2 - Week"" widgets and they both will disappear randomly (and at the same time, not separately). I am using Nova Launcher; I have other widgets which do not ever disappear on their own. EDIT response to dev: I'm trying with the stock launcher now, but sometimes it will take a day, sometimes a couple weeks"
"Excellent 👍 application, but I wish to add Arabic language, thank you."
"Forces you to sign up and use credentials, uninstalled."
"Tried the free version, it was useful enough to buy the paid version. It's a good calendar app."
"Great, intuitive app. Helping me with time management and productivity."
there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface? new is ugly
"Stephen, I've got to remove a star. I've been hoping you will address the issue that recurring tasks, once marked completed, don't go onto the next iteration- instead, they stay marked as completed and don't repeat as needed. I'm missing out on reminders for my daughter's medication if I don't remember to go uncheck the box after marking as complete. I know you are working hard & I want to support you, but I may have to go back to using Samsung reminders (ugh) since they don't have this issue."
"Enjoying this app in general, but notifications don't appear at the set time, and right now it just keeps popping up without prompting. But otherwise it's very good."
Fun and simple to use
"This is based on Wunderlist, which Microsoft bought a few years ago. They added some nice touches and ate listening to users' suggestions, but it is still a work in progress. They removed too much of what made Wunderlist good. It integrates well with Outlook, though. For now, it's useless for anything but the simplest task management."
I wish I could create notes without having to select a date. Otherwise so far so nice 🤓
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved."
I love how it integrated into my calendar and all the different features it offers while having a clean UI. Thanks Any.do Team!!
🖤IT
"So far so good. For premium I would like more aesthetics like color backgrounds and icons, stickers, etc. But the functionality is pleasing so far. I'm a habitual shopper for the perfect organizer app. Can't say I won't keep looking for a prettier one"
"Love this app, but it & my exchange outlook calendar stop syncing, even manually, every few days (not email, just calendar). Any ideas why?"
Unable to share to do list with another account
"I really loved Wunderlist, from the UI, to the functionality, all of it. Moving to To-Do has mostly been a disappointment and a minor frustration. I've encountered numerous bugs with the widget (which itself is very picky about where you aught to be tapping in a way I've found unintuitive) and the core menus feel clunky compared to Wunderlist. Since this is (supposedly) the same development team, I can only assume this will improve over time. It's not terrible, but it's not Wunderlist."
"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards."
"I wanted the ability to create project, and categorized to-do lists, and this app works perfectly. I really like the home screen widget, and when I've had questions about how to use certain features (i.e. setting a recurring task) a quick Google turns up helpful results."
Doesn't sync to calendar
"todoist is the best I've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later, while syncing with Google calendar. Unfortunately, it has a bad habit of deleting past calandar entries, especially those that repeat -don't ever modify one instance of a recurring event!"
"İ am a business owner in Azerbaijan, so my employees are not used to using alot of technology yet. I tried using other apps but they were to complicated for my team. But Any.do is really easy to use and less complicated. We use it as personal organiser but also as a company coworking platform. Really great app that i can recommend to small and medium size businesses, but u can also use it as a personal organiser. Also it is great that this app has many different language portals"
Nice
"Fun cover, stickers and layouts."
Awful the concept is great but it is not user friendly and super annoying I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it
The Concept is quite elligant yet also hard and confusing to understand. It would be eaier if there was a calendar setting and/or addition to help the user plan along with a timeline.
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb
"Pretty good app, matches description."
Don't have a monthly plan
Not felt user friendly
Loved for a while. One fine day my subtasks got deleted. It was in a task for which i didn't set any due date. Bad experience.
To do
"A intenção é boa, mas a interface é bastante confusa. || The intention is good, but the interface is too confusing"
After the recent update displays alarms an hour earlier than they actually are. Been using the app for more than a year now and love it.
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
"Below Expectation... I purchased this app based on glowing user reviews, created an account in order to sync across my devices, however I find that if I create a habit on one device it doesn't show up on my other device. This needs to be addressed immediately."
"I really like this app. Still having problems, trying to figure out how can it work best for me."
"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps"
"This app was very helpful up until the last update where they inexplicably took away the ""Lock Forest to Stay in Foreground"" feature. As of right now it's basically useless, but the support staff is great and said they were hoping to bring back the feature! So other than that it would be 5-stars. Don't change the feature that keeps people off their phones"
"Really Good App for tracking! Easy to set, access and monitor. User friendly. With this app I can control my habits. THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
"OK, it's sending hundreds of notifications with no end after an update yesterday!"
"ive downloaded all the calendar apps out there, and i like this one the most...HOWEVER, it needs to show the text on the widget not just a dot... such a bummer because i thought i found the one.. please fix this... youre so close to being the goto app for calenders for the switch off of the stock android calender... eagerly awaiting the update... 5 stars and a great review once you do it!"
I don't understand why it's not letting me type in it. It gets hanged everytime. I meant that amake ora onek birokto kortese....sorry I speak only Bahamian
Have to push too many buttons to approve my route. Not hands free friendly.
I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.
Superb
This app certainly has some really great features which others competitiors don't. Clearly have potential to be the best in the market. Cons - Sync issues Time to load up in windows 10 Bugs in habit tracker & tasks.
"Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used."
not so good
🥰🥰 it is a good app
"My experience with the app is fantastic, but a strange experience occurred, to me, i run parallel two emails, the one with which i presently registered offers Rs 909/ per annum subscription rate, on the contrary, with my new email it offers Rs 606 / per annuum. There is a huge difference of approximately 300 rupess. That's tantamount to cheating. Di satisfied and aghast with open cheating!!"
It'hs just too complicate to use for me
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions."
How do you get it to sync with your ms outlook calender? What does it mean you detailed it in #8
Works fine! Very handy organizational tool!
"I really like this app though I've only used it a week. I have some suggestions though, when I add a habit I'd like to add it for the week but not weekends. In Daily tasks I can + the same task more than once which is a bit like cheating, maybe add a pop up message that says ""you've already done that today"" 😊"
"App is good. But I want to suggest something > There should be To do list type of feature, that is what sort of things we are doing regularly from our routine will be selected and those which left undone will be not selected. In this way more clear picture of time allotment and productivity can be seen."
why would tasks be tabs instead of a list? the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs :O
Baad
"The problem I have is that if I set a habit to be every Monday and Wednesday, for example, and I follow it successfully for a few weeks. Then if I just want to change the days, it discards all my previous progress, which is stupid. I just changed the days and the app can't understand this."
Y.
Haven't used it enough to truly rate it but it just seems like there could be some big innovation if you put more thought into it. A lot of potential if you ask me though.
"Love it, it works! I would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didn't work. So I had to do them all over again. overall love it though."
That is really useful for me. I can use it for many plan and to do things and doing chores and ... . If U can add note (for writing notes and ...) And something like goal planner and program manager it will be more useful than now. TNX
It is ok
Theek hai
"I love the concept of habit bull, but it isn't user friendly"
"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted."
"very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock."
Exactly what I needed. A tool to remind me what to do. That's it 👌🙏❤️
"Limited use to Galaxy 7 phone: Has worked very well for me. However, please add an icon that pops up to let me know how many messages I have. Because I don't get many messages, I don't check it daily or more like others do."
"I like it! I waited purposely almost 3 weeks in order to give here a true opinion. This application is amazing because it has so many possibilities, like everything is open for you, you can set anything. This is why I recommend to whom wants to use it, to take the time to understand as it works. Read the user guide included in the app so you can set the application to your exact goal. So at the beginning it may not so clear, and maybe there are more friendly use apps, but this one in adjustable"
Extrem de utila. Recomand
"How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?"
It's good but it's often stopping and not responding I'm irritated by this..I need to uninstall and reinstall everytime and sync..no problem with my device as it is new and good company..please try to fix it. I'm a pro user.
"Not worth it. Doesn't have multiple times a day, you can't change a habit after initial setup, the interface is painful, get something better."
"Thia app has been a lifesaver. I have been able to organize all of my professional and personal tasks and am doing a better job of staying on top of things. I can write them down, schedule them and let them go until I am ready to handle them. A great new way of getting things done!"
"app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit. would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press OK. however you couldnt tap ok, it just did nothing. this happened every time. gave up and uninstalled the app. on a pixel 2 XL"
"I came back to this app a go three times over the last 2 years because I really wanted it to work. Each time I tried, I spent a couple of hours trying to navigate around the features and failed to get anything out of it. Incredibly unintuitive, no in app explanation, and the online ""getting started page"" doesn't explain much on what each features do. Edit: Thank you developer for the reply, it shows that you care. I wish you all the best in making the improvements, the idea behind the app is honestly good."
"I have used this after being forced to migrate from Wunderlist. The Android app works fairly well, but is not a solution when most of your work gets done on a computer. The web app that you end up using together with the Android app is complete garbage. It freezes on sufficiently complex to-do lists under current Chrome and Firefox versions and the developers can't be bothered to fix it. There are other open issues in the forums that never get addressed. This ends up making using the Android app for some use cases (manually reordering recurring tasks) required, as the browser tab will often freeze if you do it on the browser."
make it offline... then it will best appp
I like the app and it's a pity that I won't keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which I need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes
"Please Add ""Search"" option"
"It's a good app for scheduling your day although it's not great and have room for improvement. I do not know exactly what, as I am not an expert, but it feels that way. One thing that it should incorporate right away is the possibility of archiving Routines and Tags (not only keep or delete). I will rate 4 stars if they add this feature and 5 stars if they manage to make it a GREAT app for time scheduling."
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.
Good
A really nice application for arranging your day it's really nice and have a nice user friendly interface ❤️lots of love to Microsoft
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule
"I used this app last year and found it helpful. However, now when I downloaded it, I saw that there was a large number of bloat messages and permissions. Not finding it helpful anymore."
It's a good time planner/controller ...
"I wish I could give it 5 stars. Only thing missing is a Windows/Linux app for syncing, which I can't do without, and that's the only thing keeping me away. I would happily pay for that feature. If you just need an Android app, no need to look elsewhere. It has everything you can ask for. The UI is great, and very intuitive."
Amaizing app to manage with habits
"2 out of 3 features require premium. No, I am not going to do that."
Great Tool
"I had to pay for the option to change the colours, then I had to pay more to customise it further... exploitative money grabbing like this ensures I'll never recommend it to anyone else. Works well though"
Not bad
It sucks. My wife and I loved Wunderlist. We were synced with no problems. We have tried a million times to sync this bullshxt with no success.
"When I had an iPhone, I used the built in Reminder app relatively heavily to keep track of things I have to get done soon, remember something new to be done daily, or to break down a major side project into sub-tasks. Ever get a random idea and think ""shoot, I gotta try that"", just to forget it the next day. Put down a line item in this app. You may forget, but this app won't!!!"
Helps to motivate me to finish my assignments🌸 I wish it was like the old update for the plants though... the minutes you spend working grows different stages of the plant for the free plant. That one was more fun.
what???? too buke in here
I am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty .
"Is it necessary to sign up account? While making a new account it's shows error ""oops try again later"""
Only events sync....would have to uninstall
"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed."
"I like this app a lot, it is refreshing but to be 5 stars I should have more flexibility in setting intervals, like selecting days of the week so I can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat. When I add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default, I'm using the app to plan my day primarily. Finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entry's end time, with the new end time shortly after, say 30 min later. That would be a 5 star app."
"I have ADHD, and struggle to manage my time and get things done. I've tried several apps but this one seems to be the best for me so far! I cant tell you why, but I have really taken to it and its helping me loads!"
"This is an overengineered list keeping app that I hate. I kept it for years in spite of that because I was in the ecosystem, but today it locked me out of my grocery list so good riddance. No i don't need it to take thirty seconds to boot up my grocery list so that your algorithm can tell me how to most productively plan my day by sorting my grocery list in order of the order I entered each item. I do not need an any.do minute."
still working on use
"Does not work, reminders do not show up."
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.
"""your favorite features are all in To Do"" - blatant lie, To Do doesn't have email notifications like Wunderlist, for example. upd 18/05/20. and now reminders left (accidentally or intended) overnight are simply disappearing, in the morning you won't see any To Do reminders! I'm really disappointed!"
I really love this free app. It's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time I have until the next event. The only thing I would change (and this may already be available in the paid version) is the ability to choose different colors for each event.
The idea is great but the app keeps crashing every 2 days! I need to uninstall and then reinstall it if I want it to work. Plus all of my progress is gone. Can't sign up either 👎
I can't see my trees that I've grown from the chrome extension. Please explain how the extension works.
Very intuitive interface for simple habits. Handy reminders. Does just what I need.
"If I close the app, the timer still goes on and I can use other apps. So, I end up using my phone. Kindly add a feature, so that if I close the app, the timer stops or a warning comes. Rest, it's a good app."
I'm thoroughly enjoying this app so far. I've been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies. The game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing self-made goals and gaining experience and items.
Love this app
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick."
Requesting for a dark Interface and when will the Google task integration come???
"Lots of unnecessary notifications, the GUI is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app, like splurging only every X days (but no less)."
"This is an excellent application. The interface is fresh and new, and provides a new way to look at your day. I only wish that it could be made to be resized a little larger, as well as show all day events below in a list format as they are small around the bezel. Apart from that, it is a solid 5 stars!!"
Niceee
why won't my homescreen widget display all day events? this makes it really difficult to use
Dear developer I am the paid user of application. No notification sound is coming. Please see the issue urgently.
It is a pretty good concept it's just not for me
"Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items."
Very useful. Brilliant idea and elegantly executed.
Good
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!"
"I enjoy the app and it does help me stay away from my phone, but the store keeps crashing. I cant unlock any plants, and it does get prettt frustrating when i can only plant the same two plants"
"It could be great but too hard to delete an item on your agenda. It's like you put it on your agenda and it just doesn't disappear after it's over it just keeps on repeating very annoying sad that I paid the full subscription amount thinking it would help me to stay focused with my work day, but only for a few days until it started repeating itself and I tried to find a way to cancel or delete something out of the agenda completely"
"App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!"
"Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,"
Good app was finding it useful but it's not made clear how you join the guilds or when your reg for a challenge has been ac epted no space to write diary so how do you know people actually were if there was a section for diary overall I found the app very confusing
Awesome way of focusing on activities with gamification.
No complain just amazing! But I want to see more features like to create an automated pomodoro type session where I set the planting time & break time and it will go off automatically when I start. There will be definite sessions like 30 min with 4 sessions and 5 min interval in each sessions. So I don't have to set the planting time nor break time everytime I finish planting a tree. Also it would be nice to have to do task list with planting session.
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.
"Поставил бы 5, но каждый день после 12:00 ночи, если нажать на уведомление, то из шторки исчезают все уведомления приложения, которые были назначены на конкретное время. Каждую ночь надо заново назначать время заданий, потому что они исчезают в полночь..."
Feature request: 1. undo delete or bin option 2. option to adjust snooze period (remind me tmrw mrng for eg.) 3. Option to add milestone to tasks so that it will be easy to keep track of the its progress. 4. Pls add option to change the default timings like 9am 2pm etc. 5. Also while adding a task itself please give option to 'remind me after 30 mins etc' instead of going through date and time adjustment.
Love the app and the concept BUT the app keep crashing on my phone. In a weeks time I have to reinstall it 4 times.
"Please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit, I feel like I'm cheating when I delete and re-add a whole habit because it's bugging me. Otherwise the app is a gem. 3 stars till you fix this for me. It still doesn't work, I don't want to delete a task, I want to unclick a habit, because I've accidentally clicked positive/negative and I can't undo it. Even if I click the other one to make it even, it just registers it as a separate log."
It's good but complicated a bit
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.
bogus app. update isnt working. i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly. now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current.
Nice
"The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to"
"This is the overall best app that I have found for manging the things I need to do. I have downloaded 50 of the Google play stores highest rated to-do/task planner apps and nothing has come close to TickTick. The best quality of the app is the interface. 6 months ago i paid for one year subscription of the to do planner app 'any.do' and was using that until I found TickTick. I left an app i paid for to use this - which is free but can be upgraded to premium, which I plan to do."
Its great but I need to make a habit to use the app.
"Top of my wish list is ability to copy and paste events. Other than that, great app."
Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!
"It's a good app, there are many amazing functions, but there ads are very annoying"
Excellent
It wouldn't let me in
"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted."
i love it but my daily tasks dont reset at midnight so i cant use it in the morning im in western canada what timezones should i set this to so it works for me? irs just frustrating not being able to use it for the majority of my day
Easy to use. Has everything I want from a habit tracker. Great app. I use it every day.
"Absolutely terrible. Most unless app I have downloaded, to date."
I don't think that hazel-E abuse beaten pouring bleach blowtorch into lakeisha
"So far so good. I decided to buy it almost immediately. It is exactly what suit my needs. App is quite flexible despite not too much settings available. I only wish two things more in the future. One: to make tasks which are done to be crossed out or make them disappear, especially on the widget, because right now if you have many tasks there is quite chaos on the screen and it is difficult to recognize things, Second: just for fun... make possible to get some sound when you mark task done:)"
I liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them.
"This is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded. My household is full of gamers, and this is a great way to create and maintain habits, as well as track chores on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They are great about getting back to users. They have real conversations, and listen to user feedback."
This app deleted my whole google calender
Useless and time consuming. Got pro version but no option for refund
Good but notifications are not working
Good app. Have tried a few of the others. I continue to stay with this one for its featured.
"It does everything that my old task app used to do (wunderlist) but has some additional functionality which annoys me. There's a ""My day"" page which, I like as a concept, but it doesn't link to the tasks I've planned for ""today"". If I want today's tasks to appear there, I have to open the task and add it to ""my day"" which seems like a waste of time. I'd ignore that functionality entirely but it's the very first item on the app menu and it just annoys me being there not reflecting my actual day."
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb
"Decent app, but not worthy of monthly fees. What happened to 1x Pro licenses?"
Good idea but glitches...eg I incorrectly logged a day as performing a habit and could not change the fact I had actually broken the chain...
"Good app and so close to what i was looking for, but it's missing one thing. If you could add an option to add your own tasks WITHOUT it having to be an actual event that'd be awesome. I don't want to add ""wake up"" or ""gym"" as an event in my calendar."
Free version too much limited.
"Well I saw a lot of people using this app, and base on they're ratings they say it's good but for me It's not, the app constantly crashes if I click some buttons inside the apps, It always crashes whenever I try or need to use it, Please fix it I really want to use this :<"
Very useful app. But the widget is not showing my to do list. I have resize then they will appear and again after some time they get disappear
Kinda complicated. Still not used to it. I love the widgets though.
Please help. Relogging in after several months disuse. It has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken'. Will not let me progress to the app. I've tried every random letter/number combination so it's definitely not taken. Just buggy app?
I have ever seen the app which ask for watch a video to delete past record..... uninstalled Information theif.
Alarm doesn't work fine
Stupid decision to remove timer.
Ughhh gosh jus get on wid these reviews...wut yuck is this 😬😬😬👌👌👌
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling."
Was really enjoying the app but now the widgets stopped working.
"Just lowered my rating. Used to work great but now does not properly sync everything in my task list with my Google Calendar on my computer. It will sync new events & new tasks. But if I edit a task (ex. change the date of the task), it does not sync properly w/ my Google Calendar. It used to be that all edits synced & appeared the same in both the app & my Google Calendar, but not now. I have been emailing with the support for this app, but have not yet found a solution."
"Why do you have to make a microsoft account just to use a to-do list? After which it stays at a loading screen indefinitely. Yup, great app guys. Truly setting the bar high for these other apps..."
"I thought I'd like it. I like it more than I thought I would. Seeing appointments and meetings on a clock face is extremely intuitive, and having a widget that can show it on the home screen is a real boon. Fully recommended."
"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."
This app is very useful for students and other works
very useful. its where I note my accomplishments for the day as well as my planned tasks/events.. thanks to the developer of this app..
"It took 3 tries to get registered, now it wont let me change anything in character creation. I didnt even make it to setting up anything beyond skin tone before it wouldn't let me select anything. Awesome idea, crappy execution. Womp womp."
"Whole other to do list apps provide muce more for a normal user for free, you are just greedy minded pushing everything to be paid."
Dont this app have repeat task feature?
cool idea. woupd be good if it could access my outlook calendar
"Good home management app. My husband and I share a few different lists, like shopping, tasks, movies, etc, and it works for us. It's not a 5 stars because when I tried to use it as a personal daily task list, I wasn't all that satisfied. I would expect uncompleted ""day tasks"" to remain visible for the next day, or recurring weekly items which you completed this week, to disappear from your to-do list until the following recurrence."
I've been using this calendar including the first version for years. It works well with Google Calendar. I also drop the link in for my son's soccer schedule. Every time I upgrade my phone I try their calendar to compare. No comparison. I prefer this app.
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved."
"Following daily routine has kind of become cool since I've downloaded this app, it's THAT good. No complications, gives you exactly what you want and more with the colour and tag image options. And I am talking about the Free version here. Will buy the premium in future."
"Have only used the app a little while, not to bad for basic tasks. To bad you can't do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version. It's an easy app to use"
"I'm using the free version and its a disapontiment. No themes, you can't delete default lists. It's ugly."
"A multitude of options available to style your own planner/to-do list. Give it a try, and I'll bet you like it!"
Excellent app! I should've switched task apps a long time ago. This app has all the features of my old one (gtasks) and more in the free version. I love the colors for the lists. I love the repeating task option - this is critical for me. Thank you! I may donate to an app for the first time for this app!
Changing from wunderlist I was concerned it wouldn't be as good. I'm increasingly appreciating this app. Seems big improvements were made to it to reflect some of wunderlist best features. Thanks for the work put in to achieve this.
"The app is really useful, one must download it but it just have one problem that we need to refresh the widget all the time to see current time, unless we don't refresh the widget we cannot check the upcoming event through widget, if you can solve this, this is one of the best app for daily use and surely you'll get more pro version users of this app. Thank you."
"Overall i like this app, but i use it to make appointments, and it is very annoying that it won't link the name with the phone number frim the contacts automatically. You can do it manually, but it would be way quicker if it would link it automatically."
I like this app so much . It make me stay Productive. I wish it had a pause button too... but it made me focus in my studies. As a student I would like to recommend this app to you guys
I haven't found the way to edit the days of the week for one habit.
Crashing
"I have stumbled on this app just now and downloaded it immediately and found that its reminder alarm is uniquely user friendly. In tha past I used Any do and Tick Tock, but none has an alarm that works like this app. It even has a snooze button. No doubt that my efficiency will go up by leaps and bounds. I have also just now subscribed for its cloud feature . But found the charges to be too high.. I request the developer to rithink and reduce the charges and also to introduce a one time payment."
"The only thing is I thought it would love completed tasks to the end, but I can't seem to find that function anymore. It's fine, but sometimes I use to like to l back on the stuff I accomplished in a day or make sure what day something got done. No big deal."
"Uhmm...hello creator... I just want to ask when I opened the app, it glitches and it will turn back to my home. Please fix this thank you"
I'm having lots of fun. I feel motivated to do more in the day. So far I have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need. I just hope it will work for me long term!
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.
"Better than To Do, love the calendar function I could do without the frills and animations, though"
This app is fairly effective at gamifying my approach to staying focused. They have also taken care with features to make my user experience smooth and return control to me. I went ahead and purchased for some of the additional features because the price was very reasonable for the continued work they are putting in. One thing I think would be great if they could keep it as minimal and simple as the rest of the app is to let me customize self tracking that I have to do with the tagging.
"I had been using a notepad app, but you had to backspace each item as you went along. With this app, I just click the item as it is done and it marks the item as complete. With one tap, I can remove all completed tasks at once! Plus, I have everything in one place! I highly recommend!"
Lost the ability to show overdue tasks along with other open tasks in planned and tasks tab. Need this back as this is a reminder of what hasn't been done. Not much use if have to go to a separate tab to find them.
Update: June 2020: do not use this app free version. It recently started forcing full screen ads that lock your screen for the duration of the ad. Original review from 2018: Great app! Very customizable and the ads are small and non-intrusive. I've been using it for years and had only 1 issue that was resolved after contacting customer support.
"I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently. Also, every time I want to sync between my phone and my tablet I have to export it to Google Drive and then import it from the other device. Also, you can't copy items or days to another time. Please make this app more user friendly!"
awesome
"Doesnt work on ALL android Wear OS devices. Specifically, doesnt work with the Watch Active2."
I paid for the premium app and still get mashed to do a review
Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.
"Great app. I am trying to find an application like this one for a while. If you are looking for an app that will help you grow, this is the one for you. You have multiple skills to choose from. Also, you can create your own. I love that they had programming, and an Icon of Python to choose. To get the full features you need to purchase the application. However, you don't need to buy or watch annoying adds to use the application"
"Please also add the option to import few activities from any day instead of the whole day onto timeLine of a routine. Further please add the feature of allowing a to start a routine custom routine Using time interval instead of defining exact time, because on some bad days due to unavoidable circumstances we are out of schedule and adding a fresh custom timetable for the day hurts a lot modifying Timings for every activity. For rest of its features it worth 5*****."
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.
"It's cute, but the fact that I cannot view a calendar with my progress kills it for me. I am going to stick to Loop app."
"Nice app... Good layout and design.. One request- Add tracking as well to the tasks.. then it will be complete solution Along with setting up tasks I need to track as well which tasks I have done today, weekwise and monthwise"
"Is there a residual value of the service? For example if you take subscription for Evernote, it lets you catalogue your stuff and files that has future use. There is no residual value of reminder once the task is done. Do I need to pay $36 just to get a reminder? All that is needed is just one challanger app. Meanwhile there are loads of other good apps. Using tick tick as a compromise for the time being !"
"I really like the concept, but the app/widget doesn't recognise 'reminders', only 'events'. If my day was organised hour by hour with events then this would be ideal, but I rarely have more than 2 events per half day. Reminders I use all the time, if the widget recognised those then it would be far more useful to me. Would still recommend despite this."
"Do I get a premium for free, if I report a bug😅. Edited :- I was just messing with you😅. I am an android developer myself and I know how hard it is to maintain something like this. Steps to reproduce the bug. Step 1 : Fresh install the app (No data in the app) Step 2 : Press and drag hamburger icon upward. Toolbar will go upside and you will not be able to drag it back again. But you can use the navigation drawer by dragging from left to right."
Not a fan. I paid for the upgrade and it isn't working out for me. Maybe others will like it but I don't.
"Nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits. For example I want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day. The app allows only one specific time for the reminder, so please add the mentioned feature."
My suggestion to Microsoft is this. Add some statistics in the app. That will give information about the completion rate of the task. A graph will help.
"does not work properly , does not update wit hcalendar entries , worst thing , cannot aak my money back!!!!!!!"
So nice daily routine app
Inaccurate - always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't.
I do not use it so I want to cancel the subscription but am unable. Jorte had unsubscribe within opening page. Unable to sign in.
"I love this app! I can no longer install it on my WearOS watch. The app says ""installing"" on the WearOS play store, but never completes. Please fix this!"
"definetly a 4 star. good app, good concepts some bugs, not really pulling me in thou. i forgot about it, which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it. so 4 stars."
I am not able to use application in my mobile phone.
"Repeats tick now...however I encountered another problem. There's no way to restore ""purchases"". Meaning if you subscribe and than reset/wipe the app or your phone, you can't use the subscription features anymore. And to get it back you have to completely resubscribe."
"Widget has been broken with the latest update, keeps reverting back to the My Day view and then once it does that the button at the top left doesn't work anymore and so can't be switched to show other lists without removing the widget and recreating it, please fix!"
Foes the same job as wunderlist but functions better.
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff
Excellent
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule
"I try to set tasks for only specific days of the week, but it does Not work. After I complete the task that's it. It's done forever, doesn't repeat. Since most of my tasks need this feature to work...the app really isn't good for me."
I like it it's very reorganizing
"For 2.6.1: TimeTune background task error keep persists due to: screen is off, battery saver, powered off. You can also add new features: ""Refresh Background Tasks when accessing app"" toggle switch, it refreshes everytime when they accessing the app even background tasks blocked by system"
"Can't add an Outlook calendar that isn't on MS Exchange, so that means you can't add any regular personal Outlook calendar. That's pretty bad. EDIT: The developer response links to a page discussing MS Exchange-enabled Outlook accounts. My comment was regarding non-Exchange accounts. So the developer didn't even read my review properly."
"Great app. However, I was not able to sync with Google calendar and it was a deal-breaker for me. Uninstalling..."
The app was awesome but it stopped working in a week. I'm not able to add any routine now.
"overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much. I suggest adding swiping options to the task (look at nine email as an example). but overall good. might return one day :)"
"This tool really helps me see my progress so that I can feel motivated to change. When I see that I have been on a successful streak, it helps me believe that I can make positive changes for real and forever. I only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay. Also, their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts. It's kind of creepy really...but you aren't required to participate...so I ignore it."
"Lots of good features, but this morning for the 2nd time this week, all the tasks have disappeared. Last time I had to uninstall and reinstall it to have the tasks resynch. Needless to say, this is quite annoying"
"Update - Merging two tasks vanished both of them. Tried again, same result. Great App. Recommend/ Request : In Location reminders, couldn't find a way to switch the map 🗺 to Satellite 🛰 view. If it's absent, kindly add it as it is very essential to mark most locations. If I missed it, kindly 👉 me."
"I personally would like to add to this app, if I had a chance is change how the entires were set up. You had to make up the name. But it would make it better if it had a date and name. To me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper. Add more cool features that you can't find anywhere else."
Good app for task but should be linked with reminders.
"I'm trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good. The only feature I'd really like is to share reminders - is that possible? E.g. if I set a task in a shared list, I'd like everyone to receive a reminder for that task (or at least the person who has been assigned). As it stands, you can only set up reminders for yourself."
Will update down the road
"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!"
"i think the app is satisfaying my will. but the pro version keeps a non-ecard user not happy, so im giving you 3/5 bcuz of this."
Unable to turn on deep focus mode.
It's great. I love it.
"I'm enjoying the app so far. The only pain point is when editing a list item. I'm using a mobile device and it's difficult to drop the cursor at the front without accidentally checking the item off. A little more space between the writing and the check circle might eliminate this problem. It also struggled to upload a photo to a list item. An error message came up instead. Otherwise, so far so good."
Worst ap
"Stuck on setting the user name, no error message etc. Used to be good"
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.
Easy to work out the app
Does not show dates of bookings as it used to detect from emails
Very helpful for a forgetful brain like mine really helps me to keep appointments and get stuff done 👍😁 u did a great job on the app
Good.
"Best time planning app I've used! I struggle to keep tasks in order and know how much of my time they will take up. This app has all the features I need, and while I've only used it for a week, it has definitely increased my productivity. 10/10 I recommend to everyone."
"So disappointing!!! I used to love this app bit over the last few months it is Sooooooo glitchy! I just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime I think Im done, they show back up in triplicate!! Everything I changed IS STILL THERE AFTER AN HOUR!!! DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD TIME MANAGEMENT PROGRAM????? AND NO WAY TO CONTACT SUPPORT BECAUSE WHEN I TRY TO GET TO THE MENU IT SHOWS A BLACK SCREEN!!!!!"
Required me to sign in to use it? Pass.
"I'm sure the app is great seeing all the positive reviews not had earned. But having dark mode being ba premium feature is a deal breaker for me, because I would like to extensively test a product before considering a premium subscription but I can't get to use an app that forces light mode why all of my other apps are dark"
Le mode alarme ne fonctionne pas bien
Perfect app for phd student who has smart phone and need focus in his/her studies.
"The game is very buggy, I just bought a reward, then the app crashed, and the gold I've spent is gone, but I didn't receive the reward. These kind of experiences unfortunately decrease the gaming fun tremendously, and it could be such a good game otherwise!"
"It's okay application however it is not that practical. Reason is more 
often than not I have some event I'd like to add and shift around my 
routine. This is not possible at the moment (using programmer for 2 out of 
3 days is meticulous just so I can add 1 event). It would be good to have 
the ability to move and split routine items with events. In essence make 
programmer less of a hustle, and more natural and quick to use."
"Love the interface and how easy and helpful it would be, but the alarms I set do not not ring. I gave permissions to this app already, yet it doesn't. Edit: Thank you for letting me know it's a Huawei power saving issue! Are there any work-arounds the power saving mode on Huawei to still allow this app to run? The alarms are very important, without them the app is critically impaired on my device. Haha. Thanks!"
Crashing a lot after update
"The whole app is pretty broke on the note 9 (edit: I would love to report the big to help however, the settings menue does not work so I do not have the ability to send a report)."
"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male.   Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.   The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny."
This app look cool on the screen but it was hard to figure out how to use it the could be more settings added to the app so people can make it more direct for their life.
Already helped a lot. Wish it had more colors.
"it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain/lose habits and get rewarded for it, but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app. like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2,000 gold if you want to. plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things."
"Great app 😊👍 love it. Even sends me notifictaions to remind me to mark this day. Also general descussion is a good idea, its very incoraging to see other people on the app strrugling keeping habit of stuff, just makes you feel like you're not alone 👍"
"If Google Calendar integration was available with this app, it'd be loads better. Apart from that it's great. I've been using it for a while alongside other apps like Anydo and Todoist. They have a few features that I hope Microsoft builds into this app, but on the whole, I like this the most. It's simple, you can export your lists, and you can create steps for tasks."
Great
"Used to love it, but the latest version broke it. Couldn't get it to work. All widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break. Tried all settings, didn't work. Fix it and I'll reconsider my rating."
"I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone..."
Perfect!
"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together."
"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off"
I love the layout and different features. Two things that I would love changed or added are: 1. The ability to either edit a routine for a singular day or to clear a routine from a singular day (like when I have an atypical day and can't follow my regular routine); and 2. The ability to see the overlap in events/routines if two different things occur at the same time.
👍🏻
"Best calendar app for Android I've found by far. It would be nice it there was a version for windows as well but as it all syncs nicely with Google it's not a problem, just a "" would be nice to have"""
There is some sort of issue which I guess the app developers are dealing with already that the application crashes immediately after opening kindly release the update to fix this flaw quickly. The app deserves 5 stars
I wanted a to do list.. this is not such.. continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated ~ KISS
I haven't been using this very long and it's not as user friendly as the Calender that came on my last phone.  I wish instead of dots you can just see what you have entered for that day immediately without tapping on that day.  Otherwise it is easy to use and functional.
Great creative idea that does help keep me on track. I've also used it to start new good habits!
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle
"Great app which has everything I need! It's not very easy at first, but the result it gives is worth the effort. I like that you can see your characteristics in a diagram and how customizable everything is. Thank you!"
Great app
"Everything is good, except it crashes every 2 days and I have to reinstall it"
Works great. I enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer.
"I've been using the app since 2018, TickTick has been the number 1 app for me, I definately reccomend it 👏👍💯"
I have just started using this app and it looks great - except for the drop down menu from the 3 dots which doesn't show the full menu and you cannot scroll down in it either. PLEASE FIX THIS!!
Use it all the time. Its my Diary
$36 per year for push notification reminders? No thanks.
"Can't sync anymore, and all my lists are gone after I relogged (no lists when I log in through the browser either). Tried ""Get help"" but no reply for several days now."
"Better than others but I have problem in the beginning, I'll let you know later..."
"Did not enjoy the layout, workflows, rewards, explanations. A+ for the effort."
App is great....but it gets closed automatically before a session ends and my plant gets ruined..
I'm still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot. One would not waste time if they have this app in hand.
"Great concept, unfortunately sometimes a bit buggy implementation: really weird back stack handling and syncs don't work quite often. Staying with it for now hoping on things to be fixed in the future."
"It is awesome app..but if it would contain the 'PAUSE' button..it would be more meaningful, as when one need to attend something in between the activity..he can't give up the tree. Moreover it leads to false analysis of focussed hours."
"It's a great app for staying away from the phone while attending to one's tasks. As not all tasks are born equal, I'd really like to see taller trees for longer focus periods. It would be rewarding, plus the forest would look nicer and unique based on one's day"
Great product
"Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated."
"This is a wonderful app, I love the simplicity and intuitiveness - it helps me reduce stress from the many things I need to do and instead allows me to focus and get more things done overall!"
"I had opted for premium. But even basic things like I wanted to start fresh, so I said delete all tasks, but it added that as a reminder from what's app."
a little shy on functionality but for the price it can't be beat. I use it daily.
Can we please have sub tasks Placed under our main task… ? The analytics are not so useful to be honest..
Why it doesn't open in my android. It really sucks. Please do something.
"I miss the Today, Week & All shortcuts that Wunderlist had at the top. The Planned replacement is not as easy to view or follow my week ahead at a glance. The automated transfer seems to have worked well so far. UPDATE: Sharing lists previously shared with my wife now creates a double so that needs to be fixed ASAP. Wunderlist would randomly delete scheduled reminders in bulk, hopefully To Do has put a stop to that."
"Its a bit hard to use at first but if you adjust yourself , you'll get the hang of it"
"Suddenly, again (it has happened before), the widget is empty. I keep refreshing, but the entries vanish."
"JULY 2, 2020. Same problem. WORKS FOR THE FIRST TIME I OPEN IT, FOR THE NEXT ONES IT JUST IMMEDIATELY CLOSES ITSELF 6.20.2020 I can't open it. The app won't work. I have to reinstall it everytime I want to plant again."
"This product has really come a long way since I tried it in 2019. Best Android task mgr app with really clean interface and great widgets. Syncs almost immediately with web and Windows apps. Windows app includes multiple drop down widgets so you can view / edit tasks anywhere within Windows. Support has improved substantially and is generally responsive. For solo users, TickTick beats all the higher priced apps hands down. Have not tried it for teams, but it's really targeted for solo users."
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer."
"when opening a sub-task from any view, the sub-task window does not even show the main list/task it is from"
superb 👌 👌👌👌👌
Best habbit app
"doesn't do what I need it to do with setting recurring alarms, such as every 3 hours forever. it just says ""how many times"" do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly. Just daily, weekly, etc."
"I liked its features. These are well thought through. If I could go back in 
timeline, it would have been better."
"Hello, I recently shifted to a new phone. I have a premium membership. But I am unable to transfer my data to the new phone. Please help!"
"As great as this app is there is no way to turn off the annoying popups within it. 'rate us', 'congrats 10 days in a row' really? I can see the result. Please add an option to turn off all popups within the app."
"The app is really great and don't even need the paid version. Unlike what people said, I found it quite easy to set up. I wish the ""custom repeat"" had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days, as my schedule varies (schema as : 4 days A followed by 3 days B). I really love the widget option also. I just downloaded it but if I keep using it then I will consider buying the pro version to support the creators."
"I was using it and thought it was pretty good.I had my whole business schedule on it, then I lost my phone. I got a new phone and downloaded the app again, logged on and no schedule! It was gone! I lost thousands of dollars and had many clients pissed off at me... So disappointed..."
don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS
One Problem With This App Is It Stops And Also Notification Also Hide And Ask For Refresh And Troubleshooting Then It Again Start Show Every Time I Have To Open The App And Refresh Then It Start Working This Must Be Solve
Love this app. I used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load.
"Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated"
"Laggiest experience ever, icons were missing everywhere, it seemed really cool but quite unplayable for me."
"I would love to do a one/life time purchase for this app. Too bad I hate subscription based so sorry, I'd rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app."
"I have autism and downloaded this app to help mange my tasks and routine, but after trying to work it out for 10 to 20 minutes, I've decided it's not for me. I couldn't set a very simple habit of brushing my teeth twice a day, or a reminder to stretch twice a week on certain days of the week. Not as straight forward to use or set up as it seemed."
The integration with the calendar and options to enhance the entry is excessively useful. It helps to keep track of multiple issues without having to use a complex Gannt chart or spreadsheet.
worste app ever
"only been using for 3 days, easy to use"
The app always crash. I already sent a report both to your email and through the app (which I have re-downloaded many times) but still with no reply. I'm using the pro version. It is annoying that I have to re-download it every time I need to use it.
"Love this app. I use it to keep track of ongoing, long term projects. But you can use it for day to day task (to do list) management Very easy to learn your way around the app and get started quickly. Highly recommended."
"Great app. Just bought Platinum. My only issue is when setting my goal for a habit. Let's say I have a habit named '1 hour of study'. And I set my goal to doing this 5 times a day. Even if I would only do it twice (meaning 2 hours) each day the app would show it as a streak, even though I haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days. So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?"
"upon using the app so far, i wish that it would be accessible offline. other than that, the idea to challenge yourself to earn points for your habits and chores is quite remarkable"
"App is good but have some bugs.....Notification changes automatically to 
default after some time"
All the things that it advertises that it does you have to pay for disappointed
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving."
Love the functionality and the customizability! I used the watchface all the time on my wearOS watch. Only thing I wish for is the ability to use it on my new Samsung watch. Would pay alot for that feauture
Useful app
"Paywall, even for dark theme. Very disappointed"
"There is a bug: I set the widget to 70% transparent black, but after every reboot, the widget's appearance returns to the default preset."
"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you"
Tried to share a list with my husband but it won't share between my Office account and his Personal account. It's a show stopper.
"I have only been using this app for about six days, however I'm really enjoying it. I like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes. It's also affordable if you are more than five habits. One thing I think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write. Aside from that I love it so. 🤗🤗 If it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"I think that this app is honestly really fun!! and for an unmotivated student like me, this gives me more motivation to study but this app has limited rewards and it takes very long to get enough coins to buy new trees so the forest becomes boring after awhile. I recommend giving new trees as rewards after focusing for eg : 200 mins 3 days straight or something like that. this app also deleted my 2 hour study because I used my phone during the last 1 minute to check on texts from my teacher 😭😡"
confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks. just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks.
Glad my dad found this. BEST EVER. this is just amazing. You can do so many things. I am premium and boy i tell you its the best thing ever. From customizing you task to ticking of the task. This is a must have for every type of person and every age. Recomended app.
"I never give reviews. I believe in if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. My issue is not with the app itself, its the fact that I have been charge every single month for over a year! I have reached out to the developer many times and nothing. There is NO subscription for me to cancel...I am really over it with this!!!"
Very helpful app. Well organize. No problems. Highly recommended..
"2nd Edited review: The app is worst for reminders since it takes many minutes to fire. Which simply means, the app is worthless. Now the customer service told me that I'm using a cheap device, when in fact it i m using a premium budget phone. Bulls**t customer service as well since they clearly can't take the blame like a real man/woman. Bunch of frauds n scammers tryna make their customer buy their failed invention. Go fu*k urself customer service! Good luck selling nud*s coz u failed it here!"
"Everything is three colors: black, white, and bg color. Nothing feels separate or distinct, meaning I find it hard to visually separate individual tasks. To do lists should help me break down tasks not make them feel like a uniform lump. The star shouldn't be the same color as the background if it's supposed to stand out. Please make the star stand out more with a banner like Wunderlist and with a different color."
Please create desktop app
"The app itself is great, it syncs with the echo to get your tasks... Without an audible reminder of tasks though it's not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month."
"When I goto monthly view press the date the event is on, the previous date shows up. Sometimes I am able to scroll forward to the date I am looking for,but mostly not. ( for example I scroll April 24th and April 23rd shows up). I like the design of the app,would like to see yearly view. I also can't see Events I posted unless I rotate the phone. But it works for tasks and notes tabs fine?"
"Lost my custom lists and tasks after the current app update... Like the app otherwise but if it wipes your info, then whats the point? Update: was still there online, signed out of the app and back in. Its all there now!"
It is ok but maby it could be a bit more clear
Very simple and easy to use.
"Everything is good, except it crashes every 2 days and I have to reinstall it"
"Tick Tick is great. My daughter recommended it to me. She likes the natural language option. I love the option to create habits out of recurring to do tasks, that's important for me, as I'm using Tick Tick in part to try to put my life back together after my husband's death. It's very helpful to have a checklist and form habits that are little in the moment but cumulatively make a big difference. Still trying to figure out how to not have a date for a list item though (for book/grocery lists)."
It's not a good app I don't recommend it everything you have to pay for .
Good app and prompt support.
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks"
Perfect app but you need to add night mode
So far I like it I thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the Google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline. The time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential!
Really well developed system which is fun/easy to use. Since the good functions aren't blocked by premium necessities it makes this app a well worth download. Adding a schedule would however benifit as it would allow the users to keep everything on the app itself.
"When you put something in a category and then rename it, you have to re-categorise. Not amazing at sharing - list items get out of sync on multiple devices."
Fantastic app which helps to keep me organised. I have used it for over three years now. Keep up the good work.
"Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People"
"Couldn't edit any habit in this apps can't add pages, episodes, and liters bec they're not available in the edit menu.. The only way to edit a habit is to delete it."
"और इम्प्रूवमेंट चाहिए, हमारे सवाल व्हाट्स एप्प में लेवे"
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭
This app is so good for focus on your study .👍
Please can you integrate with Outlook calendar
"Great app! Intuitive navigation, easy to use. Nice integration with other apps. What's up with the lavender color designation?! I didn't think that lavender would look turquoise."
fun and easy
Good enaught
"It's so useful! My husband and I can collaborate on the grocery list, household to-do's, baby name ideas and more! Minus one star for the less than intuitive way of deleting items and lists, and it would be neat to be able to have subcategories within lists (i.e. separating the grocery list by department)."
It is completely failing on reminders!
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.
can't open
The problem is that it doesn't alarm... why.. But it is useful
"Be careful with this app. They will give free trail for few days and collect your card details. They will deduct the amount after trail period without informing you. I am struggling now, how to invoke the amount."
"All features of this app is good, as it is the same like wunderlist, however request you to add sorting as per assigne feature , which wunderlist has but missing in microsoft to list"
Poor update .... it calculates time wrongly N it reduced my coins from 533 to 510 for no reason .... earlier i really liked the app but now i dont
"I have such extensive ideas for productivity apps that a developer should retain me as a consultant before the competition gets me. None are even close to my standards, yet. One general idea for free: if a customization option that any one to-do list app has is useful, why don't they all have it?"
I don't like the layout at all. I want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks.
"It's a good app ,it has everything which a study app require or more...but only it doesn't have ranking system...."
It was decent but I remember having to tap so many times just to get it to record your progress. Not very streamlined.
I don't know if a Google update has rendered this app useless for reminders but I no longer get reminders for important events. I now have to go into the calendar app itself to view what is coming up. I'm sick of apologising to people for missed appointments. I use a Note 4.
I actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget. If I make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget?
"The widget, which is the whole reason I downloaded this app, doesn't seem to be updating anymore, even when I click the refresh button. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed."
"Este é um ótimo aplicativo, eu melhorei muito e mudei meus hábitos também, eu realmente gosto desse App.. Obrigado"
Wish I could sync it across multiple devices :(
Not able to buy plants. Unable to sign in.
It's just a skin for Google calendar.
"I really wish this had a website. Setting this up so far has been a pain in the butt. I get maybe they don't allow selecting multiple tasks to prevent cheating or something, but it really is tedious doing the same thing over and over again to 30 habits. Trying to push through it though, we'll see"
Would need an UI refresh.
no notification showing
Good
"Sorry, not Impressed I'm sorry to leave a poor review, but I thought it best to let the developers and others know I had so many challenges with it I wouldn't know where to begin. :( UPDATE: Although I initially gave the app a one star, I upgraded to two because their response was kind and professional. They asked for details of the challenges I had with the app and were genuinely pleasant to correspond with. So if you have a complaint, share kindly because they really do care. :)"
Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!
"Love it so far! Excited for the ""coming soon"" items. I use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout I want but so far this seems to be a great replacement!"
"At first glance I really liked it, but I'm having a problem where if I have a recurring task that is past due, none of the new tasks get generated until I complete the old one. And the old task's notification disappears after a few hours if I don't get to it on time. This causes me to constantly miss things if I can't get to it right away"
I don't like to put on google calendar every schedule
1 star for obligatory signup using Google /fb/twitter.
sup
Very user friendly. Highly to keep your schedule organized
"Works fine, unless you want integration with Google Calendar. It's evidently broken (reddit is filled with bug reports), and it seems they're still working on it. I hope it gets fixed soon, so I can upgrade to premium"
I have not used it right now I will download it and sharing my experience if this has changed my life or not
"Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium."
Used to be so great but for the new updates.. What's the point of Deep Focus option? It was well when it was simple and effective..
"Really great, like the pomo. If the completed tasks can be rearraged in a different order instead of being defaulted as follow an alphabetical order that'll be perfect"
It's pretty good so far. I'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps.
"It's working, but the ads are getting really annoying."
"Good and most practical application. But if app's widget could show date, day and current task and next task only or With customization option like that... This would be just awesome..."
I don't care for the dashboard
Best
"I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free."
"I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had."
"Can only track five habits without premium 🙄🙄 five habits I can just write down in a notebook instead of waiting my time with this app, I wanted to use it to build good habits for 2019 but I'm not gonna pay money to do something I can do with a pen and paper"
"Enough with the pop-up ads! I don't mind if an app has ads, but if I'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while I'm checking off my list I'm deleting your app. And no, I'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page. If I have to pay to make the app decently usable, you may as well require I pay for it to begin with."
"Have relied on this app for work since it 1st came out. Great for project management & tracking/budgeting time. REQUESTS: • Please bring back hourly repeat function (i.e. Set an event to repeat every 3 hours). It was a useful Interval timer. • CHROME EXTENSION or online version (as paid user, I'd pay more for this). • Increase maximum # of days for atypical routines, with option to create monthly routines. • Sync Google tasks & reminders (in addition to events). 2-way sync w/Google Thanks!"
"The concept is inventive, but the execution simply makes this app less than enticing to use."
"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance."
"Great app, lots of ads"
"I love the app, but you cannot add file to your task or schedule, this lack of ability to add file on such good app make it incomplete, I could have rated it 5"
"I had a 5 star on this but recent updates have made it far less simple to edit tasks, 3x more taps first to open and then change then get out of the added window that opens. Also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk. Poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers."
"Edit: Fixed with a recent update. Thank you for the fast solution! Unfortunately, a recent update has disabled one of the most important use cases for me: The ability to see all tasks relevant to today at once, which are not just the today todos, but also those overdue, otherwise those tasks are just getting more and more late if you forget to check the other filter. Just make the filter optional again please."
"Pros: I like the design overall. Reminders work well. I think the black theme is great for reducing eye strain. Cons: The search feature is lacking - if I search a single word, it may return tasks with that word in the details before tasks with that word in the title (which I would expect to see first). Task in multiple tags don't always display as expected. Can't 'select all' or 'select all by tag' to batch postpone/schedule. Can't see total # of tasks in a day selected in calendar view."
"Using this apps, i can guarantee you will never remember one single task. Needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category."
Good app
Please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window. There are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc. Check how Google Calendar widget shows information in agenda mode.
"It requires some pretty intense permissions in order to provide the best experience. It may work for you, but it didn't really work well for me."
"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue."
Is the feature of different colours for different tasks available for the free version too ?? I m actually not able to set it that way. No sir... I did the way u told me to do... It is still not showing different colours
I have an issue of widget stretching. Are there any debugs?
"The best. But, customer service is the worst. You're in luck if they respond. Getting your queries and bugs solved however is near to impossible."
"Excellent to help get organized, to dos, lists...havent used all features yet but looking to learn and utilize. U"
The notification and alarm functions don't work.
After the mandatory change from Wunderlost the app worked wothout issue until today. The app signed out of the MS account for some reason and it just kept crashing endlessly and prevented the use of my phone. Why? I also had to sign in multiple times to be able to get it right. Why change it fron Wunderlist to do a worse job? Why break something that was working?
"I'm so happy that I found this app , I've been having problems sleeping at night and for months I couldn't sleep finally I searched up ""Calming"" and this came up , at first I was like ""ugh it's not gonna help"" but now I am so thankful I found this app it's so smoothing and I can grow my trees and listen to calming music! So I fall asleep and my trees grow! Thank you so much for making this all , I love that you can turn off your phone and the app continues to grow my trees and play music!🌳🌲"
"Cancer notifications. I denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound. Now it is impossible to change or mute the sound, no matter what setting I change inside or outside the app, and whether or not I give the app the permissions it wanted. 4 stars when this is fixed."
"I really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks. But a while ago whenever I would open the app, it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if I tapped anything. The rest of my phone still works fine (doesn't freeze) while this happens. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I would love to continue using this app. Thank you! (And I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling.) Edit: Clearing did solve the problem for now. Too bad I had to give up all the progress I made. But thank you anyway, at least I can use the app again."
"This app sucks its slow and they make you pay to make checklists which is 
ridiculous"
"I've been switching between task apps for years, this seems the most intuitive and allows me to be the most productive. Quite a few features are paid for though, and although I would be willing to pay a larger upfront fee, a monthly fee isn't a commitment I'd be willing to make"
"The best habit tracker app I've seen, would've done 5 stars, but I feel like something's missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it"
"Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it. The app tends to be buggy, but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update. Since the last update drag and drop sorting of To Do (and I suspect Dailies as well) subtasks/checklists no longer works which is really frustrating. At least the website works great as always. It's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists."
No reminder for tasks
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well."
only 5 hapits for free
This is a great app and I am getting a lot more done than I was before. The only downside is that the premium subscription is a little pricey for a todo app. Seems like a lot of companies are opting for subscriptions to keep the gravy train coming instead of allowing us to buy the app outright. I'd rather own it outright than pay every year or month.
"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools."
Even after 2 years the sync is still garbage? Wow just wow...
Good app
Nice app but UX can be improved.
good but needs a true Black background option with white letters. dark grey isn't Black
I love pies. Why not make my daily schedule one! Easy to use and links to existing calendars.
"Not a big user, but my use is very satisfactory"
"Happy with the App...but personally I had two issues which are if addressed, may provide sort of convienience to the users. 1. If any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that I felt inconvenient to write the task again. 2. If any task is being feeded and there also undo/redo options are not available"
New version and now I have to wait 30 seconds and watch an ad! Just wanted to take a look at my schedule today. This is unacceptable! 30 seconds!
"A clean and simple app that I've used for a long time now. It's really been helpful for scheduling various errands, tasks and events in my calendar. Its simplicity makes it really easy to use in daily life. Highly recommended."
Terrible
"(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move"
"You're good guys. Your efforts are admirable Please consider making the app 
available to milions of people and support ""rtl""."
Please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot. It serves no purpose if I can't tell what it's for. Get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating. UX should never be an afterthought.
Very good
Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.
I've looked at about every app out there to organize tasks. This is by FAR the best out there. I've not found another with this much flexibility. I actually have not found anything I don't like about the app. Fits my every need. Great job!
"Great app! But have a few suggestions that would make it the best app in the market! Trust me people are looking for this! 1) The ability to add your schedule with a few clicks. For example you can set reoccuring events, but peoples schedules alternate. Would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work. (For reference look at the nursegrid app) 2) add your spouse or family directly. So everything is synced real time.(familywall)"

"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!"
its a great app but need to add a version were you can restore your notes if lost my app got erased by accident and i dont have any of my notes saved please consider adding to the app
this is a super helpfull app. It really motivates me to stay focussed and easily tracks my hours. I would however like to continue growing a tree after a short break in stead planting a new one. I work for short periods of time separated by 5 to 10 minute breaks. As a result I can't grow any trees beyond the first stage. I hope this feature could be added.
Love Planner Pro to keep up with tasks and appointments. Optional alarms for meetings and events are very helpful to keep me on track.
"All to do lists should embrace habit monitoring. Also, I like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed."
Better than todoist! I never thought I'll move away from todoist but it lacked some important features that TickTick has. Got the pro version. It's the only service I'm paying monthly for.
"Can be better, can be made more attractive and everything else is good"
It has helped me to increase my study time from 1to 3 hours in one study lap
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this
"Work well as my need, except it can not be watch face on Samsung watch. I try it several days and love it. So I purchase the pro version, wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with Android. I didn't know that Samsung watch is different OS, so it's incompatible :( However, the developer show responsibility by refunding the money. Anyway, I still hope it will be able to use with Samsung watch soon. Keep up the good work!"
I have been using this app for years. What l especially like is the simplicity of use..
Recurring reminders feature is not available. Let's say I want to do a particular task every day and want to have a reminder daily. I tried for it using this app but it does not work.
phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer
"It's a good app, looks polished and nice. Only problem I have is I have some tasks that repeat themselves even after I complete them, I've editted that they only come once a day but forever stay on the today tasks"
This app is being killed in the background whatever i do. I have given all the permissions. But still it is being killed. My phone is oppo A5. Please do something Devs.
Love it!! Love that it keeps what I did that day forever and crosses it out!! Just like on a piece of paper and you can have a note section!!!
"Might be good, but it doesn't have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it."
Has potential but you gotta pay
"I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!"
I loved this app before but now for some reason notifications do not pop up and I'm missing out on really important reminders.
It's notification tune is frequency low
Its most timewasting app instead! I downloaded this for schedule n it asks to buy a pro version for it! It should be mentioned first before we dwnld this app!
"Whuup, sorry, need to pay for unlimited daily task. Nope"
"I love this app! It's a perfect replacement for my paper calendar. I love that I can have my schedule, meal plan, tasks to do and more all at the tip of my fingers wherever I am. I'm excited for all the plans they have to add even more awesome features!"
"TickTick looks like a powerful and flexible productivity app but I find the help and support information across platforms somewhat overwhelming and confusing. I think that (for the easily confused) it would benefit from a good tidy-up, beginning with a clear conceptual overview of the design philosophy and architecture of the product and the methodology of its use, including flow diagrams and examples, before any specific platform advice."
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.
it is very nice game for studying
"This app is productive but the only annoying thing happened with me is that when I tried to open this app on the next day after downloading it,it was not opening I tried so many times ...."
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others. :(
Good
"Sounds like a wonderful idea for time management, but it won't show half of the things on my calendar and kind of ruins the entire purpose."
"It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package."
"Would be great, but the layout doesn't actually let you succeed in adding 
habits. Thus, useless."
"I subscribed to premium version and it was just working perfect I rate it 5 star but after latest update icon widget is not working. One more issue is there, in agenda view hide declined view option not actually working and declined events are keep showing for the whole day"
Love it! So clean
Love the app! 10/10. Most effective easily in this category.
Just works great app.
Hesitant to buy premium. I feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty. I'm on a budget and if I'm spending $5 I certainly want more bang for my buck. I wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price.
App install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks. So you have to pay to use this app. This is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install.
"Needs to access data on device, events can't be entered manually"
"Great idea, it needs some improvements imo. Edit: after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement. Faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items, you shouldn't have to refresh to see them. That also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh. Etc."
"This Agenda has changed my life. I can easily switch between family, business and personal calendars. I can color code events and the tasks lists have made my followups in business, and my daily home tasks seamless. Im no longer the mom losing my mind (as much anyway). I HIGHLY recommend!!!!"
Everytime I wanted to swap between month /day it lags so much.. If only it was smooth then I am very excited with the app.. I am using lenovo a7-3000
Loved it. Use it to reach and track your set goals.
Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. The health/experience widget doesn't display any information.
"Best one out there. However, I would like to see a swipe feature on the widget to archive or delete as oppose to a button to delete to prevent accidental touching. Turning off auto hide is a bit long winded to delete each task. 5stars if this gets added."
"Have you heard of that saying, ""Where did the time go""? Well this app helps me stay on schedule with my day instead of it just disappearing with nothing accomplished. Love the interface and very user friendly."
so good
Good app for task but should be linked with reminders.
"It was working fine until recently, I bought new bush but when I have successfully planted (it told me it was successful) I saw it planted the last tree I had chosen on previous study session and 4 out of 7 trees were dead (even tho it said I planted 7 successful trees). The notification also doesn't work"
"Amazing app. This really really helps me to increase my productivity, and to keep a note of the things which I need to do. And thank you so much for the cross platform support, I can access my tasks over my pc or anywhere I want. This app solved several problems of mine"
"I didn't understand how to add subtask in ""template"". I pressed ""save as template"", but it saved only the name of template. I couldn't find any information about template in ""help centre"". Please explain me how to add subtask in template."
"I find the app amazing. It is one of the best habit apps that I've used. The only thing I don't like is that I've bought the premium but I don't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I really needed was to have more than 7 habits but, the rest is just decoration. It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them. Another thing that would do this app just perfect, would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer. Other than that, I recommend to download it. Keep doing it so!"
"Excellent way to gamify your personal habits, with many levels of customization so you can set the difficulty levels of tasks as well as the level of self improvement those tasks provide."
"It's a good app but can be better I want the developer to fix the following please: 1-when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2-when you type in it in Persian the symbols like ""?, (,), etc"" doesn't align correctly 3 - if you add some native calendars like Persian calendar to it it will become more useful (and also an option to set it as main calendar not like Google alternative calendars that show Gregorian months not Persian months ex.)"
"Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items."
"Goooodddd benerrrrrr, so helpfulllllll"
"Please keep tinkering, and improving. Thank you for this app"
"Been using this for a long time, tremendous improvements from then up to now. Great job.!"
"I wanted to like this app. It's a very convenient way to see all the info I need right on the screen, but when I click on the task button I get trapped on the task screen with no way back. I have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode."
Helps me stay organized..
"Calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky. Can't see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists. Organize view can't use custom lists to plan my week. The sync with Google is unforgivably poor. If I change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in TickTick. This is so bad I have begun looking for replacement. I would like to see a better support forums for community feedback. Often answers are basically ""suck it up, that's just the way it is""."
Enjoying the app.
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.
I really like this apps cos it allows me to plan weekly schdules which is very important to me.
I love this planner it keeps me on schedule and I can write in Notes to clock hour's
In the latest update the widgets don't work. The app is set to dark mode but the widgets aren't. Also cannot change lists or add to lists through the widget.
"This App is useless , it works as a notepad with your tasks in it , it does not notify you of tasks you suppose to do. When the time reaches it's silent doesn't pop up even though settings have permitted it to pop up and alert , even a simple alarm clock notified me of what to do .This app Doesn't work ."
"Сам сервис очень крутой, но пожалуйста сделайте более понятный интерфейс для «Habits», пусть они они становятся серыми или изчезают, когда человек отметил свой прогресс за день. Я банально не помню, отмечала я свой прогресс сегодня или ещё нет, а показатель в виде цифры или зелёного/рыжего цвета мне ни о чем не говорит."
Good
Track future and historical vary well.
Been using for a week and so far it's the best planner/Todo app I've tried.
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.
"It's easy enough to use as it is, but for a fully paid app, the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless. All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month."
"Slowly but Steadily improve my performance and productivity on learning. Keep all us excited with more features, thank you."
"My biggest problem is that there's no free trail and a lot of stuff is behind the pay wall but I'd like to try before I buy. Also, as a first time user there's a few issues: I downloaded it on my tablet and landscape mode doesn't work well for all pages (especially the habit details page). There was also no tutorial so I was left to just click around (when I later downloaded it on my phone there was a tutorial so I'm not sure why there isn't on my tablet)."
This app so helpful to meet
Great
I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping
"While I love the app and it's customizablity, I have some issues; repeats are confusing and not easy to work about (for instance repeat times during one day and repeat times period), how difficult it is to move tasks to different days, can set specific times on reminders, difficult time building routines versus todos on it, and how hard it is to hide tasks on the calendar that should be hidden in subtasks, change easy to lose, and unable to manually order tasks by preference."
Wow! I love how well it integrates with Google's Home products. Verbally adding items to my various to do lists as well as my grocery list is awesome!!
"It's OK...but NOT free really! Costs 5 bucks to get basoc fratures on/annouying ads off. I don't feel like investing in something that in the end may or may not work out, while there are many systems that could easily replace this app. The 'routines' can be easily called 'recurring tasks' and that feature is offered by almost every respectable calendar app. Free 60 trial period would encourage me, but sneaking in payment under the label of 'free' app is what annoys me on principle! Don't do it!"
This app is perfect for getting work done and is a great way to keep track of progress!
"The best looking todo app I could find, very complete. Would be the one I use but... Unfortunately sync with Google calendar takes hours, up to a day. The issue seems to be a couple of years old (you can check it in the customer section on their website), and nothing was done to address it, while the competition syncs in seconds. If you don't need Google sync, then it's great. I'm now using another app. Sad."
"Free version does what I need, with the exception of undelete when accidentally clicking the wrong thing. However the cost of pro version too much for just that feature"
I used to love this app but since my phone updated it no longer works. I recently uninstalled and re installed I hope it works or I'll have to find something new 🙁
Update: It would make more sense to have the schedule tab as just the schedule layed out where you have the time of day scale to the left ( editable show just hours or hours and minutes) and then the activity from the routine/s at the correct time. And the only way to edit the routine could be only through the routine tab (as thats where I assume you want the main part to edit routines to be). But I love how you can save different routines for each day. Not to sure what programmer is for?
"Wonderful, but please give total version in less amount of price"
"Easy to use, sleek design. Love the funny option for the daily reminders. Keeps me focused."
Perfect works but please add more hours to focus because 3 hours is too short for me. And add Indonesia language.
Many features are available just for premium
Its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be USEFUL and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder.
Why i can't open the room from the link that people share . Every time i have to write the code to join . It's really annoying .
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it"
"I enjoyed using this app for over the past 2 years to improve my life, even if it was by a little bit. The community is kind and friendly. But I think it would be better if you could filter out what type of guild you want to join. I don't want to spend too much time scrolling down just to find the right guild."
Wish it didn't force me to use Google calendar. I wanted to start a new calender off of this app
"I think i found my perfect to do app! I'm pleased that I was able to use the same features I was using from an old app and do it on this one, plus more! It's so easy to organize and visualize all your tasks. The appearance of the app overall is excellent."
always freezing
Widget keeps reverting to my day. It didn't before. Also now often unresponsive. This change is incredibly frustrating. Please fix bugs then happy to upgrade review rating as otherwise us good. Thank you
"Not able to show the notification after the time is up. Also, it is not able to function well on counting the exceeded time or shown incorrectly. It would be of great help if you could fix the problems. Thank you:)"
"I like this app, because it fits well in my daily routines and offers very many settings, especially regarding appearance. It has some basic design flaws and misses some easy opportunities, but all in all it is a valuable application for my personal time management."
With the latest update it seems that when I update the frequency for one task it messes up the frequency and repeat days of the week for another task which is annoying as I was using the app to track my weekly tasks
Why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar? I don't want this private app to access my Google calenders and phone calender. Instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app. I'm deleting this. The UI is great. But I don't want you to link with my private apps.
"I tried hundreds of apps and thousands of ways for being focused, nut nothing helped me then I found this app and I am staying focused. This is the best one."
"Its a wonderfull app, helps in keeping a track of your habits and how consistent you are with it"
"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)"
This is worst task game in my life
Crashes all the time
"Quality, very helpful, when busy, helps track tasks and keeps dates passed as well."
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.
Helpful and easy to use. Really good app for students or people who struggle with remembering tasks they have to get done.
"Thank you for responding and I'm looking forward to that update (customized categories). Another improvement I'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one, such as save $100 per week, etc. I got the Premium and love the dark theme, this app is the best I've found for my needs. Thank you!"
"Reminder sometime not working, so i must restart the reminder. Please fix it"
"Very useful, great clock widget with my schedule. It is better if can open calendar app by touched widget."
"I paid only a few bucks for premium, and now I have it for life. I love it!"
"I had a problem with upgrading to Premium. They were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away. It's a good app for those familiar with the Franklin Covey system, and syncs well across devices."
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking."
Perfect
"Recurence tasks does not work properly, otherwise I would give 4 starts."
"Find a new app. Overall if you havent noticed, the dev's left this app. As of recently, the servers are dead. This means you cant make an account, forums are gone, motivation pictures gone, etc. Find a new app,"
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review
"Great helping app, would be 5 if events won't disappear occasionally, possibly because calendar is shared between two gmails"
"The app keeps crashing every day, and wouldn't open. Every morning I got to reinstall it and log in again... What's wrong..."
"App is so much good , best app , i want to give 5 star but not giving so that u can notice me . After its update ,my app is not opening il, if i reinstall it , my coins will lost and trees also . Please help me what to do"
"I'm in love with the app. It motivates me a lot and really helps to stay on track. Apart from the cool gamified features, it also has a huge and very friendly community, where you can get support and answers to pretty much any questions."
I like this app but it's always saying it has stopped on my phone
"Jury is still out.....would be more than happy to review.....if i was actually given the time to do so before the ""rate me rate me"" messages."
Love it! Thanks
The tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand I have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
"[1] Pls put additional sounds like instrumental music, campfire, etc. [2] an option where you can study unlimited and stop it anytime you want and still get coins [3] If the tag is changed DURING the planting process, it should reflect separately the time spent by the previous tag as well as that of the new tag so that the overall distribution is at its peak accuracy. Will put 5 stars afterwards."
"Very good at what it does, but doesn't come close to warranting a monthly charge."
Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.
"After years using Wunderlist we move on. It works. The thing missing to me is that I can not get a simple view that shows items overdue, due today, coming up in the next week . I need to look in multiple views. I have the usability issue of having to fiddle with it to toggle between today, this week, overdue, etc. I can not default to a view that gives me the information I need at a glance. I suppose I can look at ""all"" but that gives a never ending list. For me, this is a step backwards."
"bought premium version, didn't get upgrade, sent proof of payment, still no response. not good"
As I am a regular user of this app...This app needs some update like the calendar based listing method. People will go to date and list the task...Another problem is so many color for list. It's annoying... Who don't like colors they can select one color for every task list... That is all...🙂🙂🙂
Awesome app.
"Perfect, I'm loving every element so far ,I love that I can at some point once it's all done use it like my paper planner and sync them with my phone, I hate carrying my paper planner and also having to update my cell calendar , I love and cant wait to see and use all the coming soons I'm so excited ,I'm hoping also a widget will be something to come soon as well so that I can have it open on my phone and not always have to open the app for quick reference. Keep it up"
Hi I like this app 😍 it could be better if the todo list's tasks were sorted by their deadline and also today's tasks had a different color!! And a reward could be a game which needs some coins to play them! Thank you!!
I like the design and ease. Best habit tracker I've found.
I really love this app 👍
"I unistalled just for the costumer service. I was ready and willing to give the app a shot. But given the cruel, uncaring, and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works I will be uninstalling imediately."
Very easy to use. Definitely recommend.
"Helped me make a streak! I am a person who starts an activity with excitement but loses interest eventually, most likely before a week. But this app made me continue because i had to punch everyday. When i crossed 4 days it felt like I should not let it go to waste,let me continue. And then activity like drinking 3L of water everyday was easy to achieve. So when i made a one-week streak of that, the app congratulated me and built more excitement. Rest is history! 💛"
"Only day one but WOW. It's dumb how distracted we get from our phones. This has kept me focused for 45min study sessions during they day, with 30 min breaks. The material I'm studying is so dry so this really helps. If it keeps working I'll upgrade to premium. Also downloaded the night version. Keep up the good work!!!"
"Easy to use App, easy to move items up and down the list and organize categories. Like this app better than the Wunderlist app I used to have."
"In general, the app is confusing. Repeating tasks work for some time and then stop working. I have not found any clear logic behind this. The same problem was with wunderlist. Not recommended."
"I'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized. I have tried series of productivity apps before. Apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for; integration with other apps which I love. Two things I found disappointing, features are extremely limited without premium, it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive. I couldn't find statistics; from totally hours and other reports"
Please allow line wrap for a event tile in the month widget and/or month-style display
Elevates your productivity. Very neat and organized app
"My favorite habit-gamification app so far, after trying a few. Definitely minimalistic compared to Habitica, but it makes up for it in just being more functional, and with a much better system for attaching relative value/importance to various habits/to-do tasks/etc. All habit apps face the fact that it's hard to put actual numbers to how much a good habit should be ""worth"", and that scoring points you set can feel a bit like digging up treasure you buried. Do It Now handles it all well, tho"
i like the idea of planting trees and making a forest..which is really satisfaying. But this app doesn't notify me when the timer is up and it's time for break.. i have to check if the timer is still running and then set the break myself..which is the worst part! and it doesn't allow me to set multiple timer with breaks in between! if they can fix these issues..it would be a useful app
...And more!
"It works! Does what it's supposed to do, although I don't require any features other than setting an appointment/event, and being reminded of it. Unobtrusive, even when using it as a free version only. I'll probably upgrade to PRO just to reward the developer. Edit: The new 30 second ads really screw this up."
"I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for years as it was one of the best calendar apps, but now the obtrusive video ads that hold you hostage have completely changed the experience. I finally had to uninstall it because it's to the point where it's just too much. I'm understanding about banner ads if you don't want to buy the Pro version, but this is unacceptable."
"The app is good but a FAQ would be appreciated. For example, I cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks."
Good
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!
"It's actually good but then stopped working effectively since a week ... suddenly it stops and I couldn't open it...so, had to uninstall and install many a times, I also lost all my productivity due to it's sudden shutdown...mine is a pro version too..this is so bad and testing our patience.. please fix the issue.! Thankyou."
"The app itself is great, but they've started adding unskippable ads. It locked my phone and forced me to go through an ad disguised as a video game where I had to shoot criminals just to make an appointment. I had no problem with static ads to support the developers, but locking my phone until I played a dumb game ruined the app for me."
"Worst app I have ever used, it doesn't do anything."
Haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far. I LOVE that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day. I just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes. That would make this a 5-star review.
"Worked really well, however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re-added. . . Eevveerryy day. won't remember to actually use it without the widgets, so its useless now. not worth paying extra."
"why do not work reminders repeated monthly at all? one-time yes, repeated no. what is wrong?"
"I got this app to setup a schedule to work from home, and it's been good for that. I just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day. The widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen. The app could do to look a bit more modern. But all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late? Every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late (i.e. reminder set to 2:00PM, notification arrives at 2:03PM, etc.). Developers?"
"The app is good, but there are glitches. After some time when the person tries to open the app. It showed to clear the data of the app. This deletes all the storage of the app the coins collected, the forest made. This leads to the disruption of the person's analysis of their focussed work. Hope you'll soon rectify this error. And hope the soon comes early."
"this was a great idea in theory, but I want a standalone app that doesn't pull calendar data from some other app. for me and for how I wanted to use this app to manage my schedule, this just won't work. I think it could also be more user-friendly. a shame, since this really is an amazing, unique idea. devs, I hope you keep working on this and take this as constructive criticism. I would love to try this app again if things change and it becomes a more flexible standalone calendar."
Pretty good reminder app. The recurring reminders don't seem to work very well though. I'll get a reminder for the first occurrence and then nothing for any of the following events. There doesn't appear to be a way to acknowledge the original alarm without deleting it or marking the entire series as complete.
I was looking for a class schedule app and this was not it
Should have an option to add reminders. it only displays events
I have not been using app for very long. Therefore the 3 star rating. After some use I will return to rate again.
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist."
"Everything is perfect, except for the fact that daily reminders on habit check feature doesn't work."
"Beutiful and easy to use once you get used to it however I wished creating 
an event was a bit more simple and quick. Update: no longer syncs to my 
calender and the dates are all messed up....too bad I loved it"
Excellent app
Nice app but doesn't really have what I'm looking for.
"Confusing without a lot of explanation on what is what. Might be good when I figure it out, but it's not a real intuitive app and has a figure it out curve."
"Seems like a really awesome app, but blocks stuff behind a subscription or a buy all one time payment. Would rather pay piece meal. It also has ads in the free version that you can't get rid of without the sub or $50 buy all."
As someone who has eternally struggled to build and maintain habits this has made it so easy for me. I've had the app about a week (upon writing this review) and already I'm remembering my habits without prompts. I absolutely intend to buy the full version when possible and I have already recommended the app to multiple friends of mine. Absolutely great app.
It's a quite useful program. Works reliably.
You have to pay for all the decent features... There's nothing you want to do that your alarm doesn't already do
"SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists"
"I totally recommend this app. It had help me on every possible way. It's really helpful if you really want to develop a new habit. I specialy like the easyness to configure the habits and the reminders; the motivational notes that you can find around are just right. But its true that is not a magic app, PLEASE if you want to create a new habit, you have to work for it, you have to work to create something. If you do that, you'll see the true colors of this magnificent app. Be true to yourself."
auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.
Not user friendly. Almost impossible to delete or edit lists. Format is garbage.
I have so many things in the writing in the lists :D
It doesn't reset or set you reminders but it helps
"After testing the app for a while, I was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on Android. Do you know when it would be available? Also, is there a one time fee purchase option? Is there a GMAIL integration feature? Like Google Tasks? I like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app 👍. Nice work on the Widgets 👍. Thanks 🙂"
Great feature is reminder to reorganize missed and undone tasks. But ui of the app looks confusing to me. I cat find a way to add tasks easyly enought gor me. i dont know what next. google tasks are simplier and todoist have limited features in free version.
"This is the free version. The paid version is $7.99, the Platinum version is even more. You can only track 5 habits in the free version. Developers must be paid, but a lack of up front honesty makes this product undesirable. (I should charge for this.) Do not install. #doughymiddle"
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle
"It's just an ordinary built-in timer, with enhanced graphics, which doesn't notify at the completion of duration set. No other purpose it serves."
"Awesome app! Smart natural language syntax support for task management, cool UX and multi-device sync."
Another perfect mobile application ! Should send competitors teams to UI/UX design board. Excellent/perfect (hard) work !
The concept is good. But why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though I have turned the notification on? This is very bad.
The app is not upto the mark 1. Notification window is not there 2. Chat window is not available on every task
"This is a good app.... but the only problem is I cant use it properly.... because if I have planted a tree and come back to plant another one.... or to use any option in the app, I cant do it. It shows that ""unfortunately forest has stopped "".... there is no problem with my phone.... please repair this problem.... I liked the app.... but this problem is just annoying me...."
Features are good but i strongly recommend you to not install this app. Waste of time. Without any reason they freezed my account two times in one night.
I loved the franklin planners and this is as close as it comes so good job
"Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap."
"App is completely broken. Can't even make an avatar -- none of the options show up. Also, get an error message when trying to show a display name"
osm app but now its update an I am not able to see my all reminders that I use to remind my self before uninstalling the app
Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.
"I wanted to like it... I've always drooled at the idea of having a to do list app integrate with a calender. But alas, this version is clunky. You can't delete a single date of a recurring calender event, meaning you can't flexibly plan your day while beginning with a rough outline. I switched over to to-doist and Google calender instead."
"earlier this was a very good apps, suit for me and my activities. But after I installed it on my PC & change my password, the apps on my phone keeps telling me to reset password from web (even though I already did it) :( so now I can't use it on my phone coz every time I try to open the apps, it always making my phone restart"
"Nice idea, but internal app organisation is a mess where you can easily miss a task due for today"
Looks like a pretty good app but it doesn't sync with Alexa. Which is the main reason I installed it. Shouldn't be this difficult.
"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks."
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this."
A very intelligent timetable app with amazing design. Totally recommended.
"it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task"
"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work."
Feature request: 1. undo delete or bin option 2. option to adjust snooze period (remind me tmrw mrng for eg.) 3. Option to add milestone to tasks so that it will be easy to keep track of the its progress. 4. Pls add option to change the default timings like 9am 2pm etc. 5. Also while adding a task itself please give option to 'remind me after 30 mins etc' instead of going through date and time adjustment.
Awesome App that has really kept me on track. I just wish there was some type of reward system once you've reached your goal. I think regular reminders (perhaps with some form of motivation attached to it) would also encourage discipline and drive.
Its efficient and so simple to us!
It is easy. Would love to have more sort options. But I keep a lot of lists and keeps me organized.
"Really? $8 for a habit tracker? There are other apps that do the same thing for far less money. I don't mind paying for apps, but this seems like price gouging. Oh, and it's $10 if you want the ability to export your data!"
C'est très bien... mais ça devrait être moins lourd en daya
"DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional."
Necessary. Needs a little more life and interaction to its graphics
Looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars. It only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar.
No Outlook Calendar support. Most business people use Outlook...
The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer."
"Great all around GTD, Tasks, Reminder. A few that I would like to to see added: 1) add location icon WHEN setting a reminder. 2) In calendar view, a better view showing of the difference between a task and a calendar event. 3) a dedicated shortcut (activities) or widget to add a task by voice."
"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help"
Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!
Works well
"If it wasn't for the fact that the app doesn't offer separate widgets for Work Profile (I personally really need this), I'd give it 5 stars :)"
"Huge amount of functionality in free version. stopped short of 5* because duplicate functionality v limited. When i duplicate tasks I cannot duplicate to any other location than current one and cannot change name, and the new name is set as old name plus ""copied"". Would be very helpful to have duplication functionality that I can copy tasks (or indeed a whole list) and on copying them can have the duplicates placed where I wish and make choice about naming convention"
The app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working. I have bought the pro version.
Bug report - App Alerts I use both Android app (installed on Android 10) & web access. If i solve a task on web access the app also shows closed task. But I still get a push notification for the closed task on Android device
Helped me a lot
"very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock."
"So many portions of the app we're not appearing on the screen from the get go, including the first two screens entirely, and even the avartar selections."
Amazing app. I use it everyday and I feel that my life is more organized.
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc"
"I already have a subscription, it's ridiculous that It notices I already had a free trial so it obviously knows my account but its not logging me in with my premium subscription. To top it off I can't ask customer service nothing because it's not an option unless you have the premium that's ridiculous."
"Great To Do list. The only issue is location based reminders seem to be sporadic. Also annoying that you can't set all day tasks, hopefully an update soon. No resolution and tech support slow, a shame."
"Good design, simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details. However, they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year. Seems like this project was abandoned."
This is the reason I get straight A's I'm continuing with my studies and doing well in these times.The only problem I have is that once you get use to the rain sounds make focus it takes a WHILE to get use to another sound but in conclusion I really LOVE this app ❤️
"Overnight events (ie 8pm-4am) show up as All Day events in the calendar. If they are repeating, then two All Day events are shown.  Need to fix this ASAP!"
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.
Needs smart dictation like todoist and better calendar widgets like ticktick
"This is so, soooo useful! I love too much to use just ordinary words. Keep doing the good stuff! Y'all rock ~"
Thanks for ruining Wunderlist you jackasses
Tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re-open. Can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription
"Great. Better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or ""all"" view, despite priority or reminder time. That option is what sets it above. Wish that android reminders were full screen, however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time. View in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns"
"Bought the pro a few years ago. However, recently went to a new phone, and now I'm seeing ads, and it doesnt look like I have the pro version anymore. Not sure what happened but jacked up that I paid for the pro, and unable to get the functionality of the pro version without buying it again."
Good
İntuitive and straightforward approach to calendar.
Want use only not sharing
"This todo list app definately stanfs above the almost the same todo_wonderlist_tasks type of app. I love its flexibility to make your own processes, love the integration of other calendars, love the preset lists, and most importantly i love the widget! I can make a todo list widget on one screen, and my shopping list widget on the other. Plus I can make each lines super tight to see the list without to constantly scrolling up and down. Great app."
I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.
the app looks great. alot of function. it wouldn't show me any shared calenders. fix that and this is a top app
Love it so far. Wish it had a widget for Android though.
"No doubt it’s the best productivity app. It is very smooth and customizable. I liked the idea of adding a Pomo Timer & Habit tracker. Having all this features made this app unique & amazing. But the prize of the premium package is little high, that's why i'm not gonna give you 5 Stars. Anyway, it’s a great app 🔥"
"Very Helpful, The Best Yet !"
"I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called ""sleep"" just to keep it on the graph"
Paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again
"Very good. Simple and easy to use. I would like to see more statistics, because for now I can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time, but not a overall statistics."
Never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring DO NOT show in calendar even though you sync this information.
"A great app for making tasks. But, if you could add the alarm system and planning the schedule for free users, then it would be really nice...."
"Seems like a good idea but the widget is invisible. It is there, I can see the edges when I try to move it but it's completely invisible. I tried decreasing the widget transparency and deleting cache but to no avail. Devs, any clues? Thank you"
Please bring syncing with pc.
Ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
"beginning setup wasn't loading at all. signed up using Facebook. since it was not loading, i just clicked next. now I'm stuck with my Avatar with no way to change"
You can't even create an account without a purchase of the app. It costs $2.49 to make an account? EDIT: Thanks for replying
Best organizer out there. Easy to use and has an intuitive layout.
"I would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my Huawei p20, unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything, I tried removing the widget and re-doing it, now it doesn't even show my lists, and I have to go into the app to check or add things, which of course means once I'm done with the current ones I'll delete it. A task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful..."
"I would give this app 5 stars, but if you press ""silence notifications,"" you can never turn them back on."
