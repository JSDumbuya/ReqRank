"OK, I love the app, it's great, but the notifications just doesn't work, they are broken, and it's the main feature I'm looking for, fix it in order to give you the five starts"
Way over priced for what it does. Not worth it!
"So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars"
Some daily tasks just disappear a minute after I tick them. This bug is affecting me for about a week now and I'm already tired of it.
Excellent replacement for Wunderlist! A nice feature would be to automatically delete completed tasks from certain lists...or an option to print only the active list. On my iPad I nearly hit print with 400 pages of completed tasks! Other than that it's perfect.
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first."
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep
I love the concept & look of this mobile app & the desktop version. I wish I could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks. You also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into Artful Agenda. You have to add it to your Google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to Artful Agenda. I've paid for the year subscription & I'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or I won't be renewing.
This app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save
"Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts"
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
"I don't know why but this app doesn't function well on my phone. I have enabled all the settings but whenever I try to open this app it says ""forest"" keeps stopping. I love this app, but I want a way out of this problem."
The tutorial looks simple and a good layout but when I make an entry 9 out of 10 times it disappears and I need to re-enter it. Half the time dosent work
Good one
this app sucks
"Calendar has a lot of good features but half the time my reminders don't go off so I miss them. Paid for the full version but it still didn't help. All of my Friday reminders finally chimed on Sunday, kinda pointless!!"
Bom
I'd rather have continous ads than a payed time subscription. Honestly the subscription seems pretty shady for somethng you can easily do yourself... $3.69 for a month subscription and $36 bucks for a yearly subscription? Seriously? Why not just pay a premium one-time payment costing $10? Pathetic.
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.
shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly. otherwise all around good app.
The app really nice.....i request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders
"Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet."
The free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders... Kind of pointless. I'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium. The layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives. I would have considered buying if there was a one-time payment model.
"Ive used this app a couple times now, only uninstalling because school ended, but this app is amazing when it comes down to it. It encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others. Plus, it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with/rpg game like elements."
"Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for...."
"I think it's a great app, and a lot of fun. I had some trouble figuring things out at first, but everything works. The only complaint I would have is the cost... It would be nice to have some of the features, but they are too expensive."
Everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
This app stops working everytime I install it. I have already taken its subscription but now everytime I open it crashes. I have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isn't solved.
"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all."
"Really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. However, I did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days. Everything else you can edit,..time, date, category, but wanted to change my days and I had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5☆s"
"This app really draws my attention. Forest not only sends out meaningful messages (protect the green environment and save the future), but it is also a friendly reminder for me of staying focused on study and work, instead of being distracted."
"This app is brilliant! Clean, simple, and ultimately customizable. I've been wanting something like this for a while!"
"I love the app but recently the widgets have been glitching, they go blank or sometimes do respond when I click a checkbox."
Laggy.
Think its great but keeps going black and crashing all the time!
"This has everything I'm looking for from a UI perspective except one key thing: the ability to invite someone else to add/complete list items with you. It's the function Wunderlist fulfilled for us and I've been looking for a replacement ever since they were bought by MS. Add it, and it will be the dream list app I want!"
Notification is not of up to my expectation. Need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it... Besides that.. The way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect. I do love to continue using it if they update the notification part.
Nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app
loving it so far! keeps me motivated :)
"This app is so cool! It's geared towards complete configuration from the user, so give your goals the time they deserve and map it out. Once you get through learning the app, it will be an awesome tool for your future development!"
I've been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird. I don't receive reminders anymore and it's completely a waste of time to set reminders! Not very reliable right now
"The program is very good on my old phone(galaxy note 4), but notifications don't work on the new one(redmi note 8 pro). I hope you will fix them. Thanks"
"I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys."
"I very rarely leave reviews, but I have to say this is the best ""to do"" app I've ever used in my life. I've even tried all the popular ones and they didn't work for me like this one does. The notifications are amazing and I love that I can snooze them."
Good interface and design. But the sharing capabilities were riddled with issues. The app became almost unusable if you tried to share anything
Nice one
Very simple setup and gives you an idea of where you have time in your daily schedule.
"Came from Wunderlist and, to no surprise, Microsoft has managed to cause issues. My wife and I create ""tasks"" as shopping lists and they take quite a bit longer to sync than they used to if they even sync at all."
"I signed up for the pro: $30/ year is on the bordreline for me, but i feel it is worth it if it can make me even 15% more organized or disciplibed. It has some very good features and flexibility: 1) Kanban view of projects sold me; 2) a nice habit maker capability, 3) plan my day feature where you go through the tasks of the day and either keep them or postpone them."
Super Kalender App
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it"
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub."
"I have the same recurring tasks to do every day. I need a to-do-list reminder to buzz me when it's time. The problem with this app, is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day, giving me different times the next day! That is an annoying fail! Screw it, I'm going elsewhere. if I find a better app, I'll let you guys know. UPDATE : Suggestion did not work, and I found an app, that does not drift. I have moved on."
The app is only syncing my all-day events. All other events are not displaying.
Everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake .....please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.
"Of all the check list apps I've tried out, this one is the best organized, and it's customizable without being overly complicated."
"The app is great for organizing and planning, however the constantly crashing gets old really fast. Please fix this. Otherwise the app would be perfect!"
"Not a single event, appointment, meeting, etc...is showing up. going to uninstall after rating."
Nice app. it's just I feel their is always space for improvement.
"I love everything about this app, except for how it handles snoozing repeat tasks. It's easy to use and has a lot of configuration, something a lot of other apps save for the premium version. Unfortunately, I find it unusable due to how snoozing repeat tasks then alters the date/time for all future occurrences, making it difficult to manage these tasks when I just want to snooze it this one time. If this was changed I would give 5 stars and upgrade to premium as the app is otherwise perfect."
Pretty good calendar app. I like the layout of the Samsung calendar app a little better but this one has more features.
Best app to focus and study
"It's actually good but then stopped working effectively since a week ... suddenly it stops and I couldn't open it...so, had to uninstall and install many a times, I also lost all my productivity due to it's sudden shutdown...mine is a pro version too..this is so bad and testing our patience.. please fix the issue.! Thankyou."
Love the app only had for 2 days 👍
Great app stopping me from procrastinating... Actually getting things done 👍
"The app is really good, but after some time it keeps stopping! I reinstalled it two times and the third time also, the problem persists. I was forced to uninstall it finally."
"I was going to give 4 stars, but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to Google play if you said five stars, so I lowered it to 2 stars."
"Great, but have some issues with the tasks list widget. No way I can complete a task on it without its disappearing"
Lack of personal themes. Not such pleasant view as it was in Wunderlist.
The most recent update just made it harder to move times around.
Just downloaded the app better review later on
"Updates made that are not fully tested. They need to add option to revert back to the olddd verison. that was simple to use, but most importantly it worked."
Hey i was very glad to use calendar 30 until now. I can not edit anything ... If i want to delete something is reappear every time. I can't move or delete. If is not working i want my money back. I will change the review if you solve this problem. Edit :I will edit the review after you ll solve this problem. I send it an email also.
Good.
Didn't make any sense to me. I started using this app and attempted to make a sceduale but couldn't figure it out.
"There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is."
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad
App s not opening...its vry hard to uninstal .. and instal again..plz fix tis prblm..otherwise app s too gud...
Ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
"Just I love it. I don't know this app. Once I open YouTube and see what is the best apps for student. And it tells 10 apps. But I can try only this app. So it will be very helpful, greatful, joyful and totally it suits me. It is very helpful for all. Your's, Deepika"
"I'm loving the User Interface of the app. Easy to use, simplified widget display, I don't think I even need the pro version. Perfect. Completely value adding."
"Extremely easy to use. Only thing I'm having troubles with is I have an event that I set for 15mins a week, everytime I try and tap that its comoleted it asks me to set the new rule instead of just marking complete."
No notification of Habit tracks
"Really beneficial, it allows me to follow my routines efficiently"
Lots of In-app purchases ... Not worth the time .
My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options 😊
Worst app ever!!! During the import from Wonderlist it removed all of my data. Leave it to MS to screw up a great app.
"Really pretty good app; but two problems! 1. Sometimes repeat weekly reminders don't work at all, especially if you haven't ticked it the previous week! 2. Please allow multiple reminders for one event! Thanks, it's really promising and useful otherwise!"
Good
Good for those who read offline but not for those who have online studying platform.
"NEED MORE ×.WITH APP, SO FAR SOGOOD"
"Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine."
"This application is very helpful for me. Thanks ""Any.do"" for everything to remember me."
This app is crashing again and again and again. I've pro version still it keeps crashing every 2nd day. Please fix this it's damn irritating every 2nd day to get a fresh installation.
"I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar"
"There is too much WHITE everywhere. what happened to assigning colors to folders? Add some more theme colors like purple please. The latest update added color to the calendar widget for events, can you please give us the option to choose the colors? Also please bring back the old completion sound. Lowered rating because your Android Wear app hasn't been updated since 2015. Please fix to work with 2.0. I really love this app but may have to move on if it won't work on my watch."
Lately from past two days I am facing difficulty using widget. Getting an error 'task list not found' whenever I strike off a task. Please look into it ASAP.
It allows me to leave the app. I have a Techno phone. How do i fix this? Sleeptown works perfectly though.
Probably the best productivity app available for FREE! The app itself is easy to use and it's really easy to make a task/routine. Highly recommended.
"Happy with the App...but personally I had two issues which are if addressed, may provide sort of convienience to the users. 1. If any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that I felt inconvenient to write the task again. 2. If any task is being feeded and there also undo/redo options are not available"
"Just installed this yesterday. Loved it. Love the concept. Love the design. Too bad the free version can't have access to the calendar 😝 but otherwise, it's a great app. Am gonna give it a go for another few more weeks before deciding to commit to premium."
It was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars I'm losing dates appointments
it's a nice app. it make my life displined
Good
Been using this app for for years now and I really love it and help me organize stuff/schedules.
"in primo luogo, adoro... voglio dire, una lista che mi faccia giocare ed avanzare di livello come in un rpg... non posso fare altro che adorare tanterrimo in secondo luogo: probabilmente esiste un modo per impostare orari per le attività (lezioni, cose così), altrimenti non avrebbe senso poter impostare un allarme, ma... hem... io non ho idea di come si faccia (help me please) cosa numero tre: ho provato a cercarne una versione adattabile per pc e non sembra esserci... sarebbe bellissimo se ci fosse e (magari) fosse sincronizzabile ultima cosa e poi la pianto: esiste un modo per creare traguardi composti da più traguardi? mi piacerebbe avere un megaobbiettivo laurea composto dei vari esami... o campagne composte di varie sessioni..."
"i cannt acces my account anymore since their ""password reset"" feature does not work. tried on my iphone, android oreo, web version. i don't receive any email to reset my password."
The user interfaceis not good enough. It is not that much understandable
"I like it. However, I can't seem to get the notification sounds to work. They used to."
I input my appointments and it does not ring loud enough or pop up to let me know that i have an appt.  I have the paid version.  Am i doing something wrong.  IF my appt is at 11:00 do i have to input at 12:00 to get it to ring before 11:  screwy lewy. I will change my comments and rating once i get this resolved.
The new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect
"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees."
Such a great app. Helps to organize your day perfectly. Great features
"It's good but for some reason, it keeps switching around everything. And I can't seem to move them around, so I have to delete them and start again. A bit frustrating but has a great purpose."
New update causing app to freeze. Pls correct it immediately.
I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.
I like the way this app looks. Helps me feel I'm achieving things!
"It ok, gets boring after a while"
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!"
"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am."""
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭
"A novel approach to timekeeping that totally works. Effective and elegant. The best face for my smartwatch. BUT for me personally, it is always upside-down on my wrist. Can a feature be added to allow it to be rotated 180°??"
"This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions."
I'm basically lazy. This has helped me get myself into a routine somewhat. Works like a charm. And stares right into my face everytime I open (the widget) so I don't miss a thing. Great work. 👍
"So close to being my dream todo app. It claims to support Start Times but actually doesn't. You can record the start and due time, but you can't then filter a list to only show a task that has in fact started; i.e. what can I work on NOW. For me this makes start times nothing more than a tag, that I can't interact with, which totally defeats the point."
Having trouble syncing on new device; says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong.
"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!"
좋아요
"Before this, l used Wunderlist solely for my do listn I used Workflowy for ongoing notes and events throughout the years. I ike this app, but if you don't get everything done yesterday's then My Day iwhen you wake up the next day, My Day is blank. Imagine making to do list on a posted note and the next morning it was blank? That's not saving me time. Don't know why they didn't put that in when developing the app."
"wish It would link to my calendar so I can create, edit and complete in one location....that would make it 5 stars"
Used it for 1 day. Then forgot to even open it as got into new habit. It kept showing notifications and I kept ignoring it. Not much productive for me but app design is good.
Good app but you need to pay a subscription to use it fully. There isn't an option to pay for the app outright which is a shame
Crashes at start.
Not at all use ... Its not remainding with alarming then whats is the use of remainder app... Its only alarming while we open the app... Not usefull at all
"Very easy to use, good"
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited."
Alarm nahi he
Stop looking at users as cash cows. I will be uninstalling this and moving to a different app which is as good and does not nag. This is quite a good To Do app other than that it too often comes up with prompts to upgrade to the premium subscription-based version. Since when have customers disrespectfully/greedily been treated as cash cows. It used to be apps were$5 at most for a lifetime of use but now they are greedy and arrogant enough to want $5 or thereabouts per Month! I wud pay a one off
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great
It was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
No custom repeat frequency...
Not sure.
Good experience
"Once I tweaked it for GTD, this is by far the best app out there. Speedy, snappy features and performance in every platform, extremely flexible labels, categories, projects, whatever. Easy rescheduling, adding tasks in the moment and multiple ways to do almost everything . So slick."
"It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment."
"Very good. When I find myself lost in life (very often) , I swipe my trembling thumb over to Todoist, and am instantly guided back upon the path of righteous order. My day is immediately placed upon terms in which i can fully structure and understand and from which point, seize with a newfound confidence. That, or I reschedule my tasks to the next day. 10/10 I am better for it."
"Its good. The only thing that is missing is the time inclusion. Like at what time a particular task is planned. If that can be added, it would be perfect. It would be like a personal calendar and activity planner together. I hope that can be added."
"I really like how easy it is to use, that it displays your progress in a neat and easy-to-track way, and gives you options for how to measure your success (yes/no per day, #of days per week, days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat', etc). It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend."
"Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me."
"It's ok. So this is what Wunderlist became, it's pretty similar, it's intuitive but it's lost features that made it not a suitable replacement. Specially the ability to export list which include hyperlinks in the notes (or anything in the notes) and no (official) add on for a browser like chrome. Deal breakers for me, moved to TickTick. Still miss Wunderlist :("
"Firstly, thanks for your quick responses back. I appreciate it. Ok, so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app? Because there's no tutorial for that part. When I click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there's nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created."
"When you start to reschedule things, the interface is very awkward moving times around. For example, moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive"
"I can't seem to think it so I lose my calendar after 3 months and all my appointments. Is also ridiculous amount of pop-up ads.. it would be better if forwarding dates, this could be 1 step. Sometimes it is, rarely"
"I like this app👍but my routine won't work and notifications won't make 
sounds and not appear on screen..."
The app does what it says across devices. Would love a feature to add colours to the list to sort them out as per urgency. Another feature could be to give formatting options for text for additional notes within a set task.
"App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app."
"Automatically shows the reminder Snackbar when I open other apps without me setting it up, what kind of violation is this??? Stop bugging your users unsolicitedly. Uninstalled"
Alarm doesn't work fine
"I bought the premium version of this app and it doesn't work. The reminder does not function, which basically renders the app useless. I emailed the support team and I haven't gotten any response or acknowledgement of receipt. I want a refund. What a waste of my money"
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.
After the update whenever I try o buy a new kind of tree the app closes I liked the app before but now i have losed my interest in it😒😒😒😒😒 Please fix this bug..
"Am a timetune paid user , been using for more than a month. This looks like another User Interface for just reminders. Nothing more than this . An average application"
"It seems like a good app but I haven't found a way to enable a permanent notification for quick task adding. Is it only possible? EDIT: No, I mean a permanent notification that works like your widget, allowing to quickly add new tasks without opening the app. SplenDO and Any. Do have this feature for instance."
Can't understand how it works
"Best and cleanest scheduling app I've found by far. It has it all: multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals, visually effective tags, comments visible on table and notifications, widget, statistics, events, dark theme. All without adding unnecessary noise. Using it is extremely intuitive. Doesn't lock any significant features behind premium wall, instead they're just extras that are nice to have (which is a rarity). But one thing that's missing is the ability to copy events/activities."
This is most probably the best reminder app in android. I am using it for last couple of years after trying so many apps. I just love the widgets and the ad-less experience. I use it daily to manage my work. The reminder pop up is really helpful. Thank you developers.
Very easy to use. Have all I need
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.
"Very good job. A ""postpone"" option is needed. It's a priority I believe Also, would like option for completed habits to hide for the day, and option to edit categories names, icons and colours"
I wish there would be a widget on lockscreen
Seems pretty neat but i miss one feature thst is very important for me: be able to just hit start/stop for tasks thst needs to be done for at least x minutes per day. i dont check or remember time when i start doing something.
Good but have more levels
Great app
"Very user unfriendly with hardly any explanation regarding what the buttons do or the stats mean. Trying to edit tasks for each day will only let me invent new tasks, not pick from a list. Utterly confusing. Could have been so much easier."
"Seems good so far. I might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say I didn't like it or rate it now... EDIT: to reply to the response. There was only the option to review now or say I didn't like it. I would have picked review later if that was there. EDIT 2: Thanks for taking my suggestion on board, I will update this review and rating once I have used the app more 👍"
"The new video ad is really annoying, it pops out, and no way to close it unless you close the entire app. It really interrupt when you want to add a few appointments to the calendar."
"It does the job I wanted, that is to ring alarm at the set time. However I am unable to clear the timeline! That is old ones. Couldn't get much help from their help center"
This is the best app I have seen in this whole universe it has all the features everyone should download this app 😗😗😗😗😙😙😙😙
"Can be smarter, but good."
"Great, simple app. Notifications can be better; they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless."
Does not have a recurring task feature. Useless for me.
Ads that completely take over your phone and have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them.
My calendar doesn't show up
Very happy with this calendar. Have been using it for years. Thank you.
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked
Great Tool
Simple and practical
Love it
The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.
"Very effective. I would give 5 stars ,but writting space too little. Larger writting space will help much better."
"Used to be great, ads are now far too intrusive and unprofessional"
Felt more like i was wasting time instead of getting something done.
For anyone who wants to use this app: Devs stopped updating this in 2018. So they won't reply to your queries and/or issues. Look elsewhere...
Missing an important feature!!! They need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day. It is a must for someone who has ADHD. I would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature.
"Edit (since I can't seem to respond to your comment): I have the feeling the fullscreen apps appear more often than once every 18 hours, although I admittedly am not sure about this. But the x icon only appears after a timer has run out, which is partially why they're so annoying. I do understand the need for ads, and that a lot of work is put into the app, and I appreciate all your hard work on it ;)"
Useless without pro.
That's a great app
"Authors: Please stop associating every extension with this app. It's annoying this pops up when I try to open a jar file. [Edit] This means that excluding certain very popular file extensions (svg, pdf, jpg) when a file is opened from the files app, business calendar opens. This means if I try to open a Bz2 file, a AndrOffice file (odt) or a Jar file (jar). It's strange for me that Open Office files wouldn't open in AndrOffice but instead Business calendar opens instead."
"When you use the pomo timer, it automatically starts counting down when you hit what task you want yo be working on. There is no longer an icon where you can choose your white noise before starting the pomo and no way to pause the pomo once it starts so you can select your white noise. I would like to be able to select the task I'm working on, select what white noise I want, and then start the pomo; not everything automatically start."
Easy! Make your to-do list. Check it off or move it. What else do you want in a to-do app?
"EVERY service I attempted to connect (Gmail, Gtasks, google calendar,) timed out during setup (oops error). Been 2 days and still no reply from support. Device is Samsung S9 with Android 10."
"Cool concept but an app like this requires too much focus of its own which only pulls attention away from your intended project. Maybe it would be better with a more comprehensive tutorial but I doubt it. I prefer something straightforward, like Screen Time."
This app is very helpful especially for students. I can now focus on my stuff more efficiently and with real heart.
Would pay for this if there were even more additions and updates. Absolutely love it and wish they would develop it even further
"Worst Experience Ever. I signed out, & All of my Tasks list Gone.... Login bar doesn't even showing what email it was. And I don't remember my email. I was going to buy this App, but hate now. Don't have any way to backup my list."
"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect."
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.
A simple app that could not be more complicated to operate.
"I transferred from Wunderlist. I enjoy many features, especially being able to share it all with another person. They have fixed some of the comments I've seen like you can tell it to put a new item at the top of the list. Only problem I've seen is when I move a weekly item to a different day, it keeps the reminder on the day it was originally on."
"I love the overall concept, and, the diverse options for setup. Though, so many setting options are a little overwhelming to sort out. I've had the app for a few weeks and I am still trying tweak my layout ... visuals are everything for me. I believe, when originally setting up a few weeks ago, I was a bit annoyed to have spent time choosing colors for the widget to find out it is a premium feature (To Developer: plz be upfront on the premium feature options). I think once I get it really working for me it will be a fave app."
"There's a bug with the planning view, you can't see the title of the event. Other than that the app runs okay."
good
Love the app... But the reminder function is not working well . Otherwise app is awesome . Plz requested to fix it soon
It's not like the web site
"The app crashes quite often recently but when it works it's really useful to manage events and meetings, easy to use"
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know."
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?
"I'll like it more if I can the way I view this apps, difficult for me to type in landscape position"
Estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse.
I recently signed up and paid to upgrade to Business Calendar 2 Pro but am not sure how to activate. Need advice.
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse
"I'm disappointed, having lost my data twice because there is a serious lacuna in its program. When I delete a 'daily' item after completing it, it should go into the 'completed' list and its next scheduled occurrence immediately appear in the current list. But at times it doesn't happen like that, and if I've deleted it from the completed list even after some hours, it just disappears for ever. Seems that this action is server-dependent rather than being localized, and on the mercy of internet."
"Worked fine for months, now it doesn't track habits the way I set them. It treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how I have set it up. Going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app."
"Really great app ! Giving three star only because having problem to make routines! After adding five or six activities, it stops working. Can't add anymore ! Please notify me after fixing the issue."
Don't know how to use
"This is a great app, but i dun like it link to my calendar, because it will mess them up. Prefer if this is a standalone calendar, so that i can separate my schedule in this app, and other schedule in my calendar"
Works well and syncs well with the chosen calenders.
"After I purchased the pro version, all my previous tress were deleted. Contacted support. They told me to log out and for the past couple of days I have been unable to log back in. Unable to view friends list, sync, tags are not working properly,redeem gifts or plant trees with friends😑 the support team is also not helping me quite well. I have been emailing them and I am not getting clear instructions 👎 I am also unable to connect the intercom within the app."
Good one
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features."
Only deserve big zero. Because 1) I reinstalled this app 17 times in a week. No other app crashed this much times past 1 year in my phone. Your concept is awesome.. thats is why i installed this much times. But it needs a good developer....not just like todays...NOTE : Your 4.20.1 updation failed to solve this issue..
"I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right. Whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted. I did everything the helpers told me (clear cache, reinstall the app, restart phone) and nothing worked. Its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support."
"App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing"
"I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved"
"The widgets keep disappearing from my home screen Response to dev: I use both the ""BC2 - Day Pro"" and the ""BC2 - Week"" widgets and they both will disappear randomly (and at the same time, not separately). I am using Nova Launcher; I have other widgets which do not ever disappear on their own. EDIT response to dev: I'm trying with the stock launcher now, but sometimes it will take a day, sometimes a couple weeks"
"Excellent 👍 application, but I wish to add Arabic language, thank you."
"Forces you to sign up and use credentials, uninstalled."
"Tried the free version, it was useful enough to buy the paid version. It's a good calendar app."
"Great, intuitive app. Helping me with time management and productivity."
there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface? new is ugly
"Stephen, I've got to remove a star. I've been hoping you will address the issue that recurring tasks, once marked completed, don't go onto the next iteration- instead, they stay marked as completed and don't repeat as needed. I'm missing out on reminders for my daughter's medication if I don't remember to go uncheck the box after marking as complete. I know you are working hard & I want to support you, but I may have to go back to using Samsung reminders (ugh) since they don't have this issue."
"Enjoying this app in general, but notifications don't appear at the set time, and right now it just keeps popping up without prompting. But otherwise it's very good."
Fun and simple to use
"This is based on Wunderlist, which Microsoft bought a few years ago. They added some nice touches and ate listening to users' suggestions, but it is still a work in progress. They removed too much of what made Wunderlist good. It integrates well with Outlook, though. For now, it's useless for anything but the simplest task management."
I wish I could create notes without having to select a date. Otherwise so far so nice 🤓
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved."
I love how it integrated into my calendar and all the different features it offers while having a clean UI. Thanks Any.do Team!!
🖤IT
"So far so good. For premium I would like more aesthetics like color backgrounds and icons, stickers, etc. But the functionality is pleasing so far. I'm a habitual shopper for the perfect organizer app. Can't say I won't keep looking for a prettier one"
"Love this app, but it & my exchange outlook calendar stop syncing, even manually, every few days (not email, just calendar). Any ideas why?"
Unable to share to do list with another account
"I really loved Wunderlist, from the UI, to the functionality, all of it. Moving to To-Do has mostly been a disappointment and a minor frustration. I've encountered numerous bugs with the widget (which itself is very picky about where you aught to be tapping in a way I've found unintuitive) and the core menus feel clunky compared to Wunderlist. Since this is (supposedly) the same development team, I can only assume this will improve over time. It's not terrible, but it's not Wunderlist."
"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards."
"I wanted the ability to create project, and categorized to-do lists, and this app works perfectly. I really like the home screen widget, and when I've had questions about how to use certain features (i.e. setting a recurring task) a quick Google turns up helpful results."
Doesn't sync to calendar
"todoist is the best I've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later, while syncing with Google calendar. Unfortunately, it has a bad habit of deleting past calandar entries, especially those that repeat -don't ever modify one instance of a recurring event!"
"İ am a business owner in Azerbaijan, so my employees are not used to using alot of technology yet. I tried using other apps but they were to complicated for my team. But Any.do is really easy to use and less complicated. We use it as personal organiser but also as a company coworking platform. Really great app that i can recommend to small and medium size businesses, but u can also use it as a personal organiser. Also it is great that this app has many different language portals"
Nice
"Fun cover, stickers and layouts."
Awful the concept is great but it is not user friendly and super annoying I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it
The Concept is quite elligant yet also hard and confusing to understand. It would be eaier if there was a calendar setting and/or addition to help the user plan along with a timeline.
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb
"Pretty good app, matches description."
Don't have a monthly plan
Not felt user friendly
Loved for a while. One fine day my subtasks got deleted. It was in a task for which i didn't set any due date. Bad experience.
To do
"A intenção é boa, mas a interface é bastante confusa. || The intention is good, but the interface is too confusing"
After the recent update displays alarms an hour earlier than they actually are. Been using the app for more than a year now and love it.
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
"Below Expectation... I purchased this app based on glowing user reviews, created an account in order to sync across my devices, however I find that if I create a habit on one device it doesn't show up on my other device. This needs to be addressed immediately."
"I really like this app. Still having problems, trying to figure out how can it work best for me."
"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps"
"This app was very helpful up until the last update where they inexplicably took away the ""Lock Forest to Stay in Foreground"" feature. As of right now it's basically useless, but the support staff is great and said they were hoping to bring back the feature! So other than that it would be 5-stars. Don't change the feature that keeps people off their phones"
"Really Good App for tracking! Easy to set, access and monitor. User friendly. With this app I can control my habits. THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
"OK, it's sending hundreds of notifications with no end after an update yesterday!"
"ive downloaded all the calendar apps out there, and i like this one the most...HOWEVER, it needs to show the text on the widget not just a dot... such a bummer because i thought i found the one.. please fix this... youre so close to being the goto app for calenders for the switch off of the stock android calender... eagerly awaiting the update... 5 stars and a great review once you do it!"
I don't understand why it's not letting me type in it. It gets hanged everytime. I meant that amake ora onek birokto kortese....sorry I speak only Bahamian
Have to push too many buttons to approve my route. Not hands free friendly.
I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.
Superb
This app certainly has some really great features which others competitiors don't. Clearly have potential to be the best in the market. Cons - Sync issues Time to load up in windows 10 Bugs in habit tracker & tasks.
"Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used."
not so good
🥰🥰 it is a good app
"My experience with the app is fantastic, but a strange experience occurred, to me, i run parallel two emails, the one with which i presently registered offers Rs 909/ per annum subscription rate, on the contrary, with my new email it offers Rs 606 / per annuum. There is a huge difference of approximately 300 rupess. That's tantamount to cheating. Di satisfied and aghast with open cheating!!"
It'hs just too complicate to use for me
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions."
How do you get it to sync with your ms outlook calender? What does it mean you detailed it in #8
Works fine! Very handy organizational tool!
"I really like this app though I've only used it a week. I have some suggestions though, when I add a habit I'd like to add it for the week but not weekends. In Daily tasks I can + the same task more than once which is a bit like cheating, maybe add a pop up message that says ""you've already done that today"" 😊"
"App is good. But I want to suggest something > There should be To do list type of feature, that is what sort of things we are doing regularly from our routine will be selected and those which left undone will be not selected. In this way more clear picture of time allotment and productivity can be seen."
why would tasks be tabs instead of a list? the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs :O
Baad
"The problem I have is that if I set a habit to be every Monday and Wednesday, for example, and I follow it successfully for a few weeks. Then if I just want to change the days, it discards all my previous progress, which is stupid. I just changed the days and the app can't understand this."
Y.
Haven't used it enough to truly rate it but it just seems like there could be some big innovation if you put more thought into it. A lot of potential if you ask me though.
"Love it, it works! I would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didn't work. So I had to do them all over again. overall love it though."
That is really useful for me. I can use it for many plan and to do things and doing chores and ... . If U can add note (for writing notes and ...) And something like goal planner and program manager it will be more useful than now. TNX
It is ok
Theek hai
"I love the concept of habit bull, but it isn't user friendly"
"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted."
"very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock."
Exactly what I needed. A tool to remind me what to do. That's it 👌🙏❤️
"Limited use to Galaxy 7 phone: Has worked very well for me. However, please add an icon that pops up to let me know how many messages I have. Because I don't get many messages, I don't check it daily or more like others do."
"I like it! I waited purposely almost 3 weeks in order to give here a true opinion. This application is amazing because it has so many possibilities, like everything is open for you, you can set anything. This is why I recommend to whom wants to use it, to take the time to understand as it works. Read the user guide included in the app so you can set the application to your exact goal. So at the beginning it may not so clear, and maybe there are more friendly use apps, but this one in adjustable"
Extrem de utila. Recomand
"How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?"
It's good but it's often stopping and not responding I'm irritated by this..I need to uninstall and reinstall everytime and sync..no problem with my device as it is new and good company..please try to fix it. I'm a pro user.
"Not worth it. Doesn't have multiple times a day, you can't change a habit after initial setup, the interface is painful, get something better."
"Thia app has been a lifesaver. I have been able to organize all of my professional and personal tasks and am doing a better job of staying on top of things. I can write them down, schedule them and let them go until I am ready to handle them. A great new way of getting things done!"
"app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit. would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press OK. however you couldnt tap ok, it just did nothing. this happened every time. gave up and uninstalled the app. on a pixel 2 XL"
"I came back to this app a go three times over the last 2 years because I really wanted it to work. Each time I tried, I spent a couple of hours trying to navigate around the features and failed to get anything out of it. Incredibly unintuitive, no in app explanation, and the online ""getting started page"" doesn't explain much on what each features do. Edit: Thank you developer for the reply, it shows that you care. I wish you all the best in making the improvements, the idea behind the app is honestly good."
"I have used this after being forced to migrate from Wunderlist. The Android app works fairly well, but is not a solution when most of your work gets done on a computer. The web app that you end up using together with the Android app is complete garbage. It freezes on sufficiently complex to-do lists under current Chrome and Firefox versions and the developers can't be bothered to fix it. There are other open issues in the forums that never get addressed. This ends up making using the Android app for some use cases (manually reordering recurring tasks) required, as the browser tab will often freeze if you do it on the browser."
make it offline... then it will best appp
I like the app and it's a pity that I won't keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which I need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes
"Please Add ""Search"" option"
"It's a good app for scheduling your day although it's not great and have room for improvement. I do not know exactly what, as I am not an expert, but it feels that way. One thing that it should incorporate right away is the possibility of archiving Routines and Tags (not only keep or delete). I will rate 4 stars if they add this feature and 5 stars if they manage to make it a GREAT app for time scheduling."
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.
Good
A really nice application for arranging your day it's really nice and have a nice user friendly interface ❤️lots of love to Microsoft
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule
"I used this app last year and found it helpful. However, now when I downloaded it, I saw that there was a large number of bloat messages and permissions. Not finding it helpful anymore."
It's a good time planner/controller ...
"I wish I could give it 5 stars. Only thing missing is a Windows/Linux app for syncing, which I can't do without, and that's the only thing keeping me away. I would happily pay for that feature. If you just need an Android app, no need to look elsewhere. It has everything you can ask for. The UI is great, and very intuitive."
Amaizing app to manage with habits
"2 out of 3 features require premium. No, I am not going to do that."
Great Tool
"I had to pay for the option to change the colours, then I had to pay more to customise it further... exploitative money grabbing like this ensures I'll never recommend it to anyone else. Works well though"
Not bad
It sucks. My wife and I loved Wunderlist. We were synced with no problems. We have tried a million times to sync this bullshxt with no success.
"When I had an iPhone, I used the built in Reminder app relatively heavily to keep track of things I have to get done soon, remember something new to be done daily, or to break down a major side project into sub-tasks. Ever get a random idea and think ""shoot, I gotta try that"", just to forget it the next day. Put down a line item in this app. You may forget, but this app won't!!!"
Helps to motivate me to finish my assignments🌸 I wish it was like the old update for the plants though... the minutes you spend working grows different stages of the plant for the free plant. That one was more fun.
what???? too buke in here
I am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty .
"Is it necessary to sign up account? While making a new account it's shows error ""oops try again later"""
Only events sync....would have to uninstall
"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed."
"I like this app a lot, it is refreshing but to be 5 stars I should have more flexibility in setting intervals, like selecting days of the week so I can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat. When I add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default, I'm using the app to plan my day primarily. Finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entry's end time, with the new end time shortly after, say 30 min later. That would be a 5 star app."
"I have ADHD, and struggle to manage my time and get things done. I've tried several apps but this one seems to be the best for me so far! I cant tell you why, but I have really taken to it and its helping me loads!"
"This is an overengineered list keeping app that I hate. I kept it for years in spite of that because I was in the ecosystem, but today it locked me out of my grocery list so good riddance. No i don't need it to take thirty seconds to boot up my grocery list so that your algorithm can tell me how to most productively plan my day by sorting my grocery list in order of the order I entered each item. I do not need an any.do minute."
still working on use
"Does not work, reminders do not show up."
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.
"""your favorite features are all in To Do"" - blatant lie, To Do doesn't have email notifications like Wunderlist, for example. upd 18/05/20. and now reminders left (accidentally or intended) overnight are simply disappearing, in the morning you won't see any To Do reminders! I'm really disappointed!"
I really love this free app. It's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time I have until the next event. The only thing I would change (and this may already be available in the paid version) is the ability to choose different colors for each event.
The idea is great but the app keeps crashing every 2 days! I need to uninstall and then reinstall it if I want it to work. Plus all of my progress is gone. Can't sign up either 👎
I can't see my trees that I've grown from the chrome extension. Please explain how the extension works.
Very intuitive interface for simple habits. Handy reminders. Does just what I need.
"If I close the app, the timer still goes on and I can use other apps. So, I end up using my phone. Kindly add a feature, so that if I close the app, the timer stops or a warning comes. Rest, it's a good app."
I'm thoroughly enjoying this app so far. I've been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies. The game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing self-made goals and gaining experience and items.
Love this app
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick."
Requesting for a dark Interface and when will the Google task integration come???
"Lots of unnecessary notifications, the GUI is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app, like splurging only every X days (but no less)."
"This is an excellent application. The interface is fresh and new, and provides a new way to look at your day. I only wish that it could be made to be resized a little larger, as well as show all day events below in a list format as they are small around the bezel. Apart from that, it is a solid 5 stars!!"
Niceee
why won't my homescreen widget display all day events? this makes it really difficult to use
Dear developer I am the paid user of application. No notification sound is coming. Please see the issue urgently.
It is a pretty good concept it's just not for me
"Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items."
Very useful. Brilliant idea and elegantly executed.
Good
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!"
"I enjoy the app and it does help me stay away from my phone, but the store keeps crashing. I cant unlock any plants, and it does get prettt frustrating when i can only plant the same two plants"
"It could be great but too hard to delete an item on your agenda. It's like you put it on your agenda and it just doesn't disappear after it's over it just keeps on repeating very annoying sad that I paid the full subscription amount thinking it would help me to stay focused with my work day, but only for a few days until it started repeating itself and I tried to find a way to cancel or delete something out of the agenda completely"
"App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!"
"Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,"
Good app was finding it useful but it's not made clear how you join the guilds or when your reg for a challenge has been ac epted no space to write diary so how do you know people actually were if there was a section for diary overall I found the app very confusing
Awesome way of focusing on activities with gamification.
No complain just amazing! But I want to see more features like to create an automated pomodoro type session where I set the planting time & break time and it will go off automatically when I start. There will be definite sessions like 30 min with 4 sessions and 5 min interval in each sessions. So I don't have to set the planting time nor break time everytime I finish planting a tree. Also it would be nice to have to do task list with planting session.
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.
"Поставил бы 5, но каждый день после 12:00 ночи, если нажать на уведомление, то из шторки исчезают все уведомления приложения, которые были назначены на конкретное время. Каждую ночь надо заново назначать время заданий, потому что они исчезают в полночь..."
Feature request: 1. undo delete or bin option 2. option to adjust snooze period (remind me tmrw mrng for eg.) 3. Option to add milestone to tasks so that it will be easy to keep track of the its progress. 4. Pls add option to change the default timings like 9am 2pm etc. 5. Also while adding a task itself please give option to 'remind me after 30 mins etc' instead of going through date and time adjustment.
Love the app and the concept BUT the app keep crashing on my phone. In a weeks time I have to reinstall it 4 times.
"Please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit, I feel like I'm cheating when I delete and re-add a whole habit because it's bugging me. Otherwise the app is a gem. 3 stars till you fix this for me. It still doesn't work, I don't want to delete a task, I want to unclick a habit, because I've accidentally clicked positive/negative and I can't undo it. Even if I click the other one to make it even, it just registers it as a separate log."
It's good but complicated a bit
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.
bogus app. update isnt working. i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly. now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current.
Nice
"The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to"
"This is the overall best app that I have found for manging the things I need to do. I have downloaded 50 of the Google play stores highest rated to-do/task planner apps and nothing has come close to TickTick. The best quality of the app is the interface. 6 months ago i paid for one year subscription of the to do planner app 'any.do' and was using that until I found TickTick. I left an app i paid for to use this - which is free but can be upgraded to premium, which I plan to do."
Its great but I need to make a habit to use the app.
"Top of my wish list is ability to copy and paste events. Other than that, great app."
Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!
"It's a good app, there are many amazing functions, but there ads are very annoying"
Excellent
It wouldn't let me in
"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted."
i love it but my daily tasks dont reset at midnight so i cant use it in the morning im in western canada what timezones should i set this to so it works for me? irs just frustrating not being able to use it for the majority of my day
Easy to use. Has everything I want from a habit tracker. Great app. I use it every day.
"Absolutely terrible. Most unless app I have downloaded, to date."
I don't think that hazel-E abuse beaten pouring bleach blowtorch into lakeisha
"So far so good. I decided to buy it almost immediately. It is exactly what suit my needs. App is quite flexible despite not too much settings available. I only wish two things more in the future. One: to make tasks which are done to be crossed out or make them disappear, especially on the widget, because right now if you have many tasks there is quite chaos on the screen and it is difficult to recognize things, Second: just for fun... make possible to get some sound when you mark task done:)"
I liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them.
"This is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded. My household is full of gamers, and this is a great way to create and maintain habits, as well as track chores on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They are great about getting back to users. They have real conversations, and listen to user feedback."
This app deleted my whole google calender
Useless and time consuming. Got pro version but no option for refund
Good but notifications are not working
Good app. Have tried a few of the others. I continue to stay with this one for its featured.
"It does everything that my old task app used to do (wunderlist) but has some additional functionality which annoys me. There's a ""My day"" page which, I like as a concept, but it doesn't link to the tasks I've planned for ""today"". If I want today's tasks to appear there, I have to open the task and add it to ""my day"" which seems like a waste of time. I'd ignore that functionality entirely but it's the very first item on the app menu and it just annoys me being there not reflecting my actual day."
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb
"Decent app, but not worthy of monthly fees. What happened to 1x Pro licenses?"
Good idea but glitches...eg I incorrectly logged a day as performing a habit and could not change the fact I had actually broken the chain...
"Good app and so close to what i was looking for, but it's missing one thing. If you could add an option to add your own tasks WITHOUT it having to be an actual event that'd be awesome. I don't want to add ""wake up"" or ""gym"" as an event in my calendar."
Free version too much limited.
"Well I saw a lot of people using this app, and base on they're ratings they say it's good but for me It's not, the app constantly crashes if I click some buttons inside the apps, It always crashes whenever I try or need to use it, Please fix it I really want to use this :<"
Very useful app. But the widget is not showing my to do list. I have resize then they will appear and again after some time they get disappear
Kinda complicated. Still not used to it. I love the widgets though.
Please help. Relogging in after several months disuse. It has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken'. Will not let me progress to the app. I've tried every random letter/number combination so it's definitely not taken. Just buggy app?
I have ever seen the app which ask for watch a video to delete past record..... uninstalled Information theif.
Alarm doesn't work fine
Stupid decision to remove timer.
Ughhh gosh jus get on wid these reviews...wut yuck is this 😬😬😬👌👌👌
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling."
Was really enjoying the app but now the widgets stopped working.
"Just lowered my rating. Used to work great but now does not properly sync everything in my task list with my Google Calendar on my computer. It will sync new events & new tasks. But if I edit a task (ex. change the date of the task), it does not sync properly w/ my Google Calendar. It used to be that all edits synced & appeared the same in both the app & my Google Calendar, but not now. I have been emailing with the support for this app, but have not yet found a solution."
"Why do you have to make a microsoft account just to use a to-do list? After which it stays at a loading screen indefinitely. Yup, great app guys. Truly setting the bar high for these other apps..."
"I thought I'd like it. I like it more than I thought I would. Seeing appointments and meetings on a clock face is extremely intuitive, and having a widget that can show it on the home screen is a real boon. Fully recommended."
"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."
This app is very useful for students and other works
very useful. its where I note my accomplishments for the day as well as my planned tasks/events.. thanks to the developer of this app..
"It took 3 tries to get registered, now it wont let me change anything in character creation. I didnt even make it to setting up anything beyond skin tone before it wouldn't let me select anything. Awesome idea, crappy execution. Womp womp."
"Whole other to do list apps provide muce more for a normal user for free, you are just greedy minded pushing everything to be paid."
Dont this app have repeat task feature?
cool idea. woupd be good if it could access my outlook calendar
"Good home management app. My husband and I share a few different lists, like shopping, tasks, movies, etc, and it works for us. It's not a 5 stars because when I tried to use it as a personal daily task list, I wasn't all that satisfied. I would expect uncompleted ""day tasks"" to remain visible for the next day, or recurring weekly items which you completed this week, to disappear from your to-do list until the following recurrence."
I've been using this calendar including the first version for years. It works well with Google Calendar. I also drop the link in for my son's soccer schedule. Every time I upgrade my phone I try their calendar to compare. No comparison. I prefer this app.
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved."
"Following daily routine has kind of become cool since I've downloaded this app, it's THAT good. No complications, gives you exactly what you want and more with the colour and tag image options. And I am talking about the Free version here. Will buy the premium in future."
"Have only used the app a little while, not to bad for basic tasks. To bad you can't do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version. It's an easy app to use"
"I'm using the free version and its a disapontiment. No themes, you can't delete default lists. It's ugly."
"A multitude of options available to style your own planner/to-do list. Give it a try, and I'll bet you like it!"
Excellent app! I should've switched task apps a long time ago. This app has all the features of my old one (gtasks) and more in the free version. I love the colors for the lists. I love the repeating task option - this is critical for me. Thank you! I may donate to an app for the first time for this app!
Changing from wunderlist I was concerned it wouldn't be as good. I'm increasingly appreciating this app. Seems big improvements were made to it to reflect some of wunderlist best features. Thanks for the work put in to achieve this.
"The app is really useful, one must download it but it just have one problem that we need to refresh the widget all the time to see current time, unless we don't refresh the widget we cannot check the upcoming event through widget, if you can solve this, this is one of the best app for daily use and surely you'll get more pro version users of this app. Thank you."
"Overall i like this app, but i use it to make appointments, and it is very annoying that it won't link the name with the phone number frim the contacts automatically. You can do it manually, but it would be way quicker if it would link it automatically."
I like this app so much . It make me stay Productive. I wish it had a pause button too... but it made me focus in my studies. As a student I would like to recommend this app to you guys
I haven't found the way to edit the days of the week for one habit.
Crashing
"I have stumbled on this app just now and downloaded it immediately and found that its reminder alarm is uniquely user friendly. In tha past I used Any do and Tick Tock, but none has an alarm that works like this app. It even has a snooze button. No doubt that my efficiency will go up by leaps and bounds. I have also just now subscribed for its cloud feature . But found the charges to be too high.. I request the developer to rithink and reduce the charges and also to introduce a one time payment."
"The only thing is I thought it would love completed tasks to the end, but I can't seem to find that function anymore. It's fine, but sometimes I use to like to l back on the stuff I accomplished in a day or make sure what day something got done. No big deal."
"Uhmm...hello creator... I just want to ask when I opened the app, it glitches and it will turn back to my home. Please fix this thank you"
I'm having lots of fun. I feel motivated to do more in the day. So far I have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need. I just hope it will work for me long term!
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.
"Better than To Do, love the calendar function I could do without the frills and animations, though"
This app is fairly effective at gamifying my approach to staying focused. They have also taken care with features to make my user experience smooth and return control to me. I went ahead and purchased for some of the additional features because the price was very reasonable for the continued work they are putting in. One thing I think would be great if they could keep it as minimal and simple as the rest of the app is to let me customize self tracking that I have to do with the tagging.
"I had been using a notepad app, but you had to backspace each item as you went along. With this app, I just click the item as it is done and it marks the item as complete. With one tap, I can remove all completed tasks at once! Plus, I have everything in one place! I highly recommend!"
Lost the ability to show overdue tasks along with other open tasks in planned and tasks tab. Need this back as this is a reminder of what hasn't been done. Not much use if have to go to a separate tab to find them.
Update: June 2020: do not use this app free version. It recently started forcing full screen ads that lock your screen for the duration of the ad. Original review from 2018: Great app! Very customizable and the ads are small and non-intrusive. I've been using it for years and had only 1 issue that was resolved after contacting customer support.
"I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently. Also, every time I want to sync between my phone and my tablet I have to export it to Google Drive and then import it from the other device. Also, you can't copy items or days to another time. Please make this app more user friendly!"
awesome
"Doesnt work on ALL android Wear OS devices. Specifically, doesnt work with the Watch Active2."
I paid for the premium app and still get mashed to do a review
Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.
"Great app. I am trying to find an application like this one for a while. If you are looking for an app that will help you grow, this is the one for you. You have multiple skills to choose from. Also, you can create your own. I love that they had programming, and an Icon of Python to choose. To get the full features you need to purchase the application. However, you don't need to buy or watch annoying adds to use the application"
"Please also add the option to import few activities from any day instead of the whole day onto timeLine of a routine. Further please add the feature of allowing a to start a routine custom routine Using time interval instead of defining exact time, because on some bad days due to unavoidable circumstances we are out of schedule and adding a fresh custom timetable for the day hurts a lot modifying Timings for every activity. For rest of its features it worth 5*****."
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.
"It's cute, but the fact that I cannot view a calendar with my progress kills it for me. I am going to stick to Loop app."
"Nice app... Good layout and design.. One request- Add tracking as well to the tasks.. then it will be complete solution Along with setting up tasks I need to track as well which tasks I have done today, weekwise and monthwise"
"Is there a residual value of the service? For example if you take subscription for Evernote, it lets you catalogue your stuff and files that has future use. There is no residual value of reminder once the task is done. Do I need to pay $36 just to get a reminder? All that is needed is just one challanger app. Meanwhile there are loads of other good apps. Using tick tick as a compromise for the time being !"
"I really like the concept, but the app/widget doesn't recognise 'reminders', only 'events'. If my day was organised hour by hour with events then this would be ideal, but I rarely have more than 2 events per half day. Reminders I use all the time, if the widget recognised those then it would be far more useful to me. Would still recommend despite this."
"Do I get a premium for free, if I report a bug😅. Edited :- I was just messing with you😅. I am an android developer myself and I know how hard it is to maintain something like this. Steps to reproduce the bug. Step 1 : Fresh install the app (No data in the app) Step 2 : Press and drag hamburger icon upward. Toolbar will go upside and you will not be able to drag it back again. But you can use the navigation drawer by dragging from left to right."
Not a fan. I paid for the upgrade and it isn't working out for me. Maybe others will like it but I don't.
"Nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits. For example I want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day. The app allows only one specific time for the reminder, so please add the mentioned feature."
My suggestion to Microsoft is this. Add some statistics in the app. That will give information about the completion rate of the task. A graph will help.
"does not work properly , does not update wit hcalendar entries , worst thing , cannot aak my money back!!!!!!!"
So nice daily routine app
Inaccurate - always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't.
I do not use it so I want to cancel the subscription but am unable. Jorte had unsubscribe within opening page. Unable to sign in.
"I love this app! I can no longer install it on my WearOS watch. The app says ""installing"" on the WearOS play store, but never completes. Please fix this!"
"definetly a 4 star. good app, good concepts some bugs, not really pulling me in thou. i forgot about it, which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it. so 4 stars."
I am not able to use application in my mobile phone.
"Repeats tick now...however I encountered another problem. There's no way to restore ""purchases"". Meaning if you subscribe and than reset/wipe the app or your phone, you can't use the subscription features anymore. And to get it back you have to completely resubscribe."
"Widget has been broken with the latest update, keeps reverting back to the My Day view and then once it does that the button at the top left doesn't work anymore and so can't be switched to show other lists without removing the widget and recreating it, please fix!"
Foes the same job as wunderlist but functions better.
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff
Excellent
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule
"I try to set tasks for only specific days of the week, but it does Not work. After I complete the task that's it. It's done forever, doesn't repeat. Since most of my tasks need this feature to work...the app really isn't good for me."
I like it it's very reorganizing
"For 2.6.1: TimeTune background task error keep persists due to: screen is off, battery saver, powered off. You can also add new features: ""Refresh Background Tasks when accessing app"" toggle switch, it refreshes everytime when they accessing the app even background tasks blocked by system"
"Can't add an Outlook calendar that isn't on MS Exchange, so that means you can't add any regular personal Outlook calendar. That's pretty bad. EDIT: The developer response links to a page discussing MS Exchange-enabled Outlook accounts. My comment was regarding non-Exchange accounts. So the developer didn't even read my review properly."
"Great app. However, I was not able to sync with Google calendar and it was a deal-breaker for me. Uninstalling..."
The app was awesome but it stopped working in a week. I'm not able to add any routine now.
"overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much. I suggest adding swiping options to the task (look at nine email as an example). but overall good. might return one day :)"
"This tool really helps me see my progress so that I can feel motivated to change. When I see that I have been on a successful streak, it helps me believe that I can make positive changes for real and forever. I only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay. Also, their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts. It's kind of creepy really...but you aren't required to participate...so I ignore it."
"Lots of good features, but this morning for the 2nd time this week, all the tasks have disappeared. Last time I had to uninstall and reinstall it to have the tasks resynch. Needless to say, this is quite annoying"
"Update - Merging two tasks vanished both of them. Tried again, same result. Great App. Recommend/ Request : In Location reminders, couldn't find a way to switch the map 🗺 to Satellite 🛰 view. If it's absent, kindly add it as it is very essential to mark most locations. If I missed it, kindly 👉 me."
"I personally would like to add to this app, if I had a chance is change how the entires were set up. You had to make up the name. But it would make it better if it had a date and name. To me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper. Add more cool features that you can't find anywhere else."
Good app for task but should be linked with reminders.
"I'm trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good. The only feature I'd really like is to share reminders - is that possible? E.g. if I set a task in a shared list, I'd like everyone to receive a reminder for that task (or at least the person who has been assigned). As it stands, you can only set up reminders for yourself."
Will update down the road
"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!"
"i think the app is satisfaying my will. but the pro version keeps a non-ecard user not happy, so im giving you 3/5 bcuz of this."
Unable to turn on deep focus mode.
It's great. I love it.
"I'm enjoying the app so far. The only pain point is when editing a list item. I'm using a mobile device and it's difficult to drop the cursor at the front without accidentally checking the item off. A little more space between the writing and the check circle might eliminate this problem. It also struggled to upload a photo to a list item. An error message came up instead. Otherwise, so far so good."
Worst ap
"Stuck on setting the user name, no error message etc. Used to be good"
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.
Easy to work out the app
Does not show dates of bookings as it used to detect from emails
Very helpful for a forgetful brain like mine really helps me to keep appointments and get stuff done 👍😁 u did a great job on the app
Good.
"Best time planning app I've used! I struggle to keep tasks in order and know how much of my time they will take up. This app has all the features I need, and while I've only used it for a week, it has definitely increased my productivity. 10/10 I recommend to everyone."
"So disappointing!!! I used to love this app bit over the last few months it is Sooooooo glitchy! I just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime I think Im done, they show back up in triplicate!! Everything I changed IS STILL THERE AFTER AN HOUR!!! DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD TIME MANAGEMENT PROGRAM????? AND NO WAY TO CONTACT SUPPORT BECAUSE WHEN I TRY TO GET TO THE MENU IT SHOWS A BLACK SCREEN!!!!!"
Required me to sign in to use it? Pass.
"I'm sure the app is great seeing all the positive reviews not had earned. But having dark mode being ba premium feature is a deal breaker for me, because I would like to extensively test a product before considering a premium subscription but I can't get to use an app that forces light mode why all of my other apps are dark"
Le mode alarme ne fonctionne pas bien
Perfect app for phd student who has smart phone and need focus in his/her studies.
"The game is very buggy, I just bought a reward, then the app crashed, and the gold I've spent is gone, but I didn't receive the reward. These kind of experiences unfortunately decrease the gaming fun tremendously, and it could be such a good game otherwise!"
"It's okay application however it is not that practical. Reason is more 
often than not I have some event I'd like to add and shift around my 
routine. This is not possible at the moment (using programmer for 2 out of 
3 days is meticulous just so I can add 1 event). It would be good to have 
the ability to move and split routine items with events. In essence make 
programmer less of a hustle, and more natural and quick to use."
"Love the interface and how easy and helpful it would be, but the alarms I set do not not ring. I gave permissions to this app already, yet it doesn't. Edit: Thank you for letting me know it's a Huawei power saving issue! Are there any work-arounds the power saving mode on Huawei to still allow this app to run? The alarms are very important, without them the app is critically impaired on my device. Haha. Thanks!"
Crashing a lot after update
"The whole app is pretty broke on the note 9 (edit: I would love to report the big to help however, the settings menue does not work so I do not have the ability to send a report)."
"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male.   Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.   The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny."
This app look cool on the screen but it was hard to figure out how to use it the could be more settings added to the app so people can make it more direct for their life.
Already helped a lot. Wish it had more colors.
"it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain/lose habits and get rewarded for it, but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app. like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2,000 gold if you want to. plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things."
"Great app 😊👍 love it. Even sends me notifictaions to remind me to mark this day. Also general descussion is a good idea, its very incoraging to see other people on the app strrugling keeping habit of stuff, just makes you feel like you're not alone 👍"
"If Google Calendar integration was available with this app, it'd be loads better. Apart from that it's great. I've been using it for a while alongside other apps like Anydo and Todoist. They have a few features that I hope Microsoft builds into this app, but on the whole, I like this the most. It's simple, you can export your lists, and you can create steps for tasks."
Great
"Used to love it, but the latest version broke it. Couldn't get it to work. All widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break. Tried all settings, didn't work. Fix it and I'll reconsider my rating."
"I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone..."
Perfect!
"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together."
"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off"
I love the layout and different features. Two things that I would love changed or added are: 1. The ability to either edit a routine for a singular day or to clear a routine from a singular day (like when I have an atypical day and can't follow my regular routine); and 2. The ability to see the overlap in events/routines if two different things occur at the same time.
👍🏻
"Best calendar app for Android I've found by far. It would be nice it there was a version for windows as well but as it all syncs nicely with Google it's not a problem, just a "" would be nice to have"""
There is some sort of issue which I guess the app developers are dealing with already that the application crashes immediately after opening kindly release the update to fix this flaw quickly. The app deserves 5 stars
I wanted a to do list.. this is not such.. continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated ~ KISS
I haven't been using this very long and it's not as user friendly as the Calender that came on my last phone.  I wish instead of dots you can just see what you have entered for that day immediately without tapping on that day.  Otherwise it is easy to use and functional.
Great creative idea that does help keep me on track. I've also used it to start new good habits!
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle
"Great app which has everything I need! It's not very easy at first, but the result it gives is worth the effort. I like that you can see your characteristics in a diagram and how customizable everything is. Thank you!"
Great app
"Everything is good, except it crashes every 2 days and I have to reinstall it"
Works great. I enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer.
"I've been using the app since 2018, TickTick has been the number 1 app for me, I definately reccomend it 👏👍💯"
I have just started using this app and it looks great - except for the drop down menu from the 3 dots which doesn't show the full menu and you cannot scroll down in it either. PLEASE FIX THIS!!
Use it all the time. Its my Diary
$36 per year for push notification reminders? No thanks.
"Can't sync anymore, and all my lists are gone after I relogged (no lists when I log in through the browser either). Tried ""Get help"" but no reply for several days now."
"Better than others but I have problem in the beginning, I'll let you know later..."
"Did not enjoy the layout, workflows, rewards, explanations. A+ for the effort."
App is great....but it gets closed automatically before a session ends and my plant gets ruined..
I'm still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot. One would not waste time if they have this app in hand.
"Great concept, unfortunately sometimes a bit buggy implementation: really weird back stack handling and syncs don't work quite often. Staying with it for now hoping on things to be fixed in the future."
"It is awesome app..but if it would contain the 'PAUSE' button..it would be more meaningful, as when one need to attend something in between the activity..he can't give up the tree. Moreover it leads to false analysis of focussed hours."
"It's a great app for staying away from the phone while attending to one's tasks. As not all tasks are born equal, I'd really like to see taller trees for longer focus periods. It would be rewarding, plus the forest would look nicer and unique based on one's day"
Great product
"Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated."
"This is a wonderful app, I love the simplicity and intuitiveness - it helps me reduce stress from the many things I need to do and instead allows me to focus and get more things done overall!"
"I had opted for premium. But even basic things like I wanted to start fresh, so I said delete all tasks, but it added that as a reminder from what's app."
a little shy on functionality but for the price it can't be beat. I use it daily.
Can we please have sub tasks Placed under our main task… ? The analytics are not so useful to be honest..
Why it doesn't open in my android. It really sucks. Please do something.
"I miss the Today, Week & All shortcuts that Wunderlist had at the top. The Planned replacement is not as easy to view or follow my week ahead at a glance. The automated transfer seems to have worked well so far. UPDATE: Sharing lists previously shared with my wife now creates a double so that needs to be fixed ASAP. Wunderlist would randomly delete scheduled reminders in bulk, hopefully To Do has put a stop to that."
"Its a bit hard to use at first but if you adjust yourself , you'll get the hang of it"
"Suddenly, again (it has happened before), the widget is empty. I keep refreshing, but the entries vanish."
"JULY 2, 2020. Same problem. WORKS FOR THE FIRST TIME I OPEN IT, FOR THE NEXT ONES IT JUST IMMEDIATELY CLOSES ITSELF 6.20.2020 I can't open it. The app won't work. I have to reinstall it everytime I want to plant again."
"This product has really come a long way since I tried it in 2019. Best Android task mgr app with really clean interface and great widgets. Syncs almost immediately with web and Windows apps. Windows app includes multiple drop down widgets so you can view / edit tasks anywhere within Windows. Support has improved substantially and is generally responsive. For solo users, TickTick beats all the higher priced apps hands down. Have not tried it for teams, but it's really targeted for solo users."
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer."
"when opening a sub-task from any view, the sub-task window does not even show the main list/task it is from"
superb 👌 👌👌👌👌
Best habbit app
"doesn't do what I need it to do with setting recurring alarms, such as every 3 hours forever. it just says ""how many times"" do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly. Just daily, weekly, etc."
"I liked its features. These are well thought through. If I could go back in 
timeline, it would have been better."
"Hello, I recently shifted to a new phone. I have a premium membership. But I am unable to transfer my data to the new phone. Please help!"
"As great as this app is there is no way to turn off the annoying popups within it. 'rate us', 'congrats 10 days in a row' really? I can see the result. Please add an option to turn off all popups within the app."
"The app is really great and don't even need the paid version. Unlike what people said, I found it quite easy to set up. I wish the ""custom repeat"" had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days, as my schedule varies (schema as : 4 days A followed by 3 days B). I really love the widget option also. I just downloaded it but if I keep using it then I will consider buying the pro version to support the creators."
"I was using it and thought it was pretty good.I had my whole business schedule on it, then I lost my phone. I got a new phone and downloaded the app again, logged on and no schedule! It was gone! I lost thousands of dollars and had many clients pissed off at me... So disappointed..."
don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS
One Problem With This App Is It Stops And Also Notification Also Hide And Ask For Refresh And Troubleshooting Then It Again Start Show Every Time I Have To Open The App And Refresh Then It Start Working This Must Be Solve
Love this app. I used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load.
"Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated"
"Laggiest experience ever, icons were missing everywhere, it seemed really cool but quite unplayable for me."
"I would love to do a one/life time purchase for this app. Too bad I hate subscription based so sorry, I'd rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app."
"I have autism and downloaded this app to help mange my tasks and routine, but after trying to work it out for 10 to 20 minutes, I've decided it's not for me. I couldn't set a very simple habit of brushing my teeth twice a day, or a reminder to stretch twice a week on certain days of the week. Not as straight forward to use or set up as it seemed."
The integration with the calendar and options to enhance the entry is excessively useful. It helps to keep track of multiple issues without having to use a complex Gannt chart or spreadsheet.
worste app ever
"only been using for 3 days, easy to use"
The app always crash. I already sent a report both to your email and through the app (which I have re-downloaded many times) but still with no reply. I'm using the pro version. It is annoying that I have to re-download it every time I need to use it.
"Love this app. I use it to keep track of ongoing, long term projects. But you can use it for day to day task (to do list) management Very easy to learn your way around the app and get started quickly. Highly recommended."
"Great app. Just bought Platinum. My only issue is when setting my goal for a habit. Let's say I have a habit named '1 hour of study'. And I set my goal to doing this 5 times a day. Even if I would only do it twice (meaning 2 hours) each day the app would show it as a streak, even though I haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days. So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?"
"upon using the app so far, i wish that it would be accessible offline. other than that, the idea to challenge yourself to earn points for your habits and chores is quite remarkable"
"App is good but have some bugs.....Notification changes automatically to 
default after some time"
All the things that it advertises that it does you have to pay for disappointed
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving."
Love the functionality and the customizability! I used the watchface all the time on my wearOS watch. Only thing I wish for is the ability to use it on my new Samsung watch. Would pay alot for that feauture
Useful app
"Paywall, even for dark theme. Very disappointed"
"There is a bug: I set the widget to 70% transparent black, but after every reboot, the widget's appearance returns to the default preset."
"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you"
Tried to share a list with my husband but it won't share between my Office account and his Personal account. It's a show stopper.
"I have only been using this app for about six days, however I'm really enjoying it. I like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes. It's also affordable if you are more than five habits. One thing I think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write. Aside from that I love it so. 🤗🤗 If it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"I think that this app is honestly really fun!! and for an unmotivated student like me, this gives me more motivation to study but this app has limited rewards and it takes very long to get enough coins to buy new trees so the forest becomes boring after awhile. I recommend giving new trees as rewards after focusing for eg : 200 mins 3 days straight or something like that. this app also deleted my 2 hour study because I used my phone during the last 1 minute to check on texts from my teacher 😭😡"
confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks. just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks.
Glad my dad found this. BEST EVER. this is just amazing. You can do so many things. I am premium and boy i tell you its the best thing ever. From customizing you task to ticking of the task. This is a must have for every type of person and every age. Recomended app.
"I never give reviews. I believe in if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. My issue is not with the app itself, its the fact that I have been charge every single month for over a year! I have reached out to the developer many times and nothing. There is NO subscription for me to cancel...I am really over it with this!!!"
Very helpful app. Well organize. No problems. Highly recommended..
"2nd Edited review: The app is worst for reminders since it takes many minutes to fire. Which simply means, the app is worthless. Now the customer service told me that I'm using a cheap device, when in fact it i m using a premium budget phone. Bulls**t customer service as well since they clearly can't take the blame like a real man/woman. Bunch of frauds n scammers tryna make their customer buy their failed invention. Go fu*k urself customer service! Good luck selling nud*s coz u failed it here!"
"Everything is three colors: black, white, and bg color. Nothing feels separate or distinct, meaning I find it hard to visually separate individual tasks. To do lists should help me break down tasks not make them feel like a uniform lump. The star shouldn't be the same color as the background if it's supposed to stand out. Please make the star stand out more with a banner like Wunderlist and with a different color."
Please create desktop app
"The app itself is great, it syncs with the echo to get your tasks... Without an audible reminder of tasks though it's not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month."
"When I goto monthly view press the date the event is on, the previous date shows up. Sometimes I am able to scroll forward to the date I am looking for,but mostly not. ( for example I scroll April 24th and April 23rd shows up). I like the design of the app,would like to see yearly view. I also can't see Events I posted unless I rotate the phone. But it works for tasks and notes tabs fine?"
"Lost my custom lists and tasks after the current app update... Like the app otherwise but if it wipes your info, then whats the point? Update: was still there online, signed out of the app and back in. Its all there now!"
It is ok but maby it could be a bit more clear
Very simple and easy to use.
"Everything is good, except it crashes every 2 days and I have to reinstall it"
"Tick Tick is great. My daughter recommended it to me. She likes the natural language option. I love the option to create habits out of recurring to do tasks, that's important for me, as I'm using Tick Tick in part to try to put my life back together after my husband's death. It's very helpful to have a checklist and form habits that are little in the moment but cumulatively make a big difference. Still trying to figure out how to not have a date for a list item though (for book/grocery lists)."
It's not a good app I don't recommend it everything you have to pay for .
Good app and prompt support.
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks"
Perfect app but you need to add night mode
So far I like it I thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the Google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline. The time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential!
Really well developed system which is fun/easy to use. Since the good functions aren't blocked by premium necessities it makes this app a well worth download. Adding a schedule would however benifit as it would allow the users to keep everything on the app itself.
"When you put something in a category and then rename it, you have to re-categorise. Not amazing at sharing - list items get out of sync on multiple devices."
Fantastic app which helps to keep me organised. I have used it for over three years now. Keep up the good work.
"Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People"
"Couldn't edit any habit in this apps can't add pages, episodes, and liters bec they're not available in the edit menu.. The only way to edit a habit is to delete it."
"और इम्प्रूवमेंट चाहिए, हमारे सवाल व्हाट्स एप्प में लेवे"
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭
This app is so good for focus on your study .👍
Please can you integrate with Outlook calendar
"Great app! Intuitive navigation, easy to use. Nice integration with other apps. What's up with the lavender color designation?! I didn't think that lavender would look turquoise."
fun and easy
Good enaught
"It's so useful! My husband and I can collaborate on the grocery list, household to-do's, baby name ideas and more! Minus one star for the less than intuitive way of deleting items and lists, and it would be neat to be able to have subcategories within lists (i.e. separating the grocery list by department)."
It is completely failing on reminders!
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.
can't open
The problem is that it doesn't alarm... why.. But it is useful
"Be careful with this app. They will give free trail for few days and collect your card details. They will deduct the amount after trail period without informing you. I am struggling now, how to invoke the amount."
"All features of this app is good, as it is the same like wunderlist, however request you to add sorting as per assigne feature , which wunderlist has but missing in microsoft to list"
Poor update .... it calculates time wrongly N it reduced my coins from 533 to 510 for no reason .... earlier i really liked the app but now i dont
"I have such extensive ideas for productivity apps that a developer should retain me as a consultant before the competition gets me. None are even close to my standards, yet. One general idea for free: if a customization option that any one to-do list app has is useful, why don't they all have it?"
I don't like the layout at all. I want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks.
"It's a good app ,it has everything which a study app require or more...but only it doesn't have ranking system...."
It was decent but I remember having to tap so many times just to get it to record your progress. Not very streamlined.
I don't know if a Google update has rendered this app useless for reminders but I no longer get reminders for important events. I now have to go into the calendar app itself to view what is coming up. I'm sick of apologising to people for missed appointments. I use a Note 4.
I actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget. If I make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget?
"The widget, which is the whole reason I downloaded this app, doesn't seem to be updating anymore, even when I click the refresh button. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed."
"Este é um ótimo aplicativo, eu melhorei muito e mudei meus hábitos também, eu realmente gosto desse App.. Obrigado"
Wish I could sync it across multiple devices :(
Not able to buy plants. Unable to sign in.
It's just a skin for Google calendar.
"I really wish this had a website. Setting this up so far has been a pain in the butt. I get maybe they don't allow selecting multiple tasks to prevent cheating or something, but it really is tedious doing the same thing over and over again to 30 habits. Trying to push through it though, we'll see"
Would need an UI refresh.
no notification showing
Good
"Sorry, not Impressed I'm sorry to leave a poor review, but I thought it best to let the developers and others know I had so many challenges with it I wouldn't know where to begin. :( UPDATE: Although I initially gave the app a one star, I upgraded to two because their response was kind and professional. They asked for details of the challenges I had with the app and were genuinely pleasant to correspond with. So if you have a complaint, share kindly because they really do care. :)"
Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!
"Love it so far! Excited for the ""coming soon"" items. I use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout I want but so far this seems to be a great replacement!"
"At first glance I really liked it, but I'm having a problem where if I have a recurring task that is past due, none of the new tasks get generated until I complete the old one. And the old task's notification disappears after a few hours if I don't get to it on time. This causes me to constantly miss things if I can't get to it right away"
I don't like to put on google calendar every schedule
1 star for obligatory signup using Google /fb/twitter.
sup
Very user friendly. Highly to keep your schedule organized
"Works fine, unless you want integration with Google Calendar. It's evidently broken (reddit is filled with bug reports), and it seems they're still working on it. I hope it gets fixed soon, so I can upgrade to premium"
I have not used it right now I will download it and sharing my experience if this has changed my life or not
"Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium."
Used to be so great but for the new updates.. What's the point of Deep Focus option? It was well when it was simple and effective..
"Really great, like the pomo. If the completed tasks can be rearraged in a different order instead of being defaulted as follow an alphabetical order that'll be perfect"
It's pretty good so far. I'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps.
"It's working, but the ads are getting really annoying."
"Good and most practical application. But if app's widget could show date, day and current task and next task only or With customization option like that... This would be just awesome..."
I don't care for the dashboard
Best
"I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free."
"I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had."
"Can only track five habits without premium 🙄🙄 five habits I can just write down in a notebook instead of waiting my time with this app, I wanted to use it to build good habits for 2019 but I'm not gonna pay money to do something I can do with a pen and paper"
"Enough with the pop-up ads! I don't mind if an app has ads, but if I'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while I'm checking off my list I'm deleting your app. And no, I'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page. If I have to pay to make the app decently usable, you may as well require I pay for it to begin with."
"Have relied on this app for work since it 1st came out. Great for project management & tracking/budgeting time. REQUESTS: • Please bring back hourly repeat function (i.e. Set an event to repeat every 3 hours). It was a useful Interval timer. • CHROME EXTENSION or online version (as paid user, I'd pay more for this). • Increase maximum # of days for atypical routines, with option to create monthly routines. • Sync Google tasks & reminders (in addition to events). 2-way sync w/Google Thanks!"
"The concept is inventive, but the execution simply makes this app less than enticing to use."
"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance."
"Great app, lots of ads"
"I love the app, but you cannot add file to your task or schedule, this lack of ability to add file on such good app make it incomplete, I could have rated it 5"
"I had a 5 star on this but recent updates have made it far less simple to edit tasks, 3x more taps first to open and then change then get out of the added window that opens. Also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk. Poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers."
"Edit: Fixed with a recent update. Thank you for the fast solution! Unfortunately, a recent update has disabled one of the most important use cases for me: The ability to see all tasks relevant to today at once, which are not just the today todos, but also those overdue, otherwise those tasks are just getting more and more late if you forget to check the other filter. Just make the filter optional again please."
"Pros: I like the design overall. Reminders work well. I think the black theme is great for reducing eye strain. Cons: The search feature is lacking - if I search a single word, it may return tasks with that word in the details before tasks with that word in the title (which I would expect to see first). Task in multiple tags don't always display as expected. Can't 'select all' or 'select all by tag' to batch postpone/schedule. Can't see total # of tasks in a day selected in calendar view."
"Using this apps, i can guarantee you will never remember one single task. Needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category."
Good app
Please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window. There are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc. Check how Google Calendar widget shows information in agenda mode.
"It requires some pretty intense permissions in order to provide the best experience. It may work for you, but it didn't really work well for me."
"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue."
Is the feature of different colours for different tasks available for the free version too ?? I m actually not able to set it that way. No sir... I did the way u told me to do... It is still not showing different colours
I have an issue of widget stretching. Are there any debugs?
"The best. But, customer service is the worst. You're in luck if they respond. Getting your queries and bugs solved however is near to impossible."
"Excellent to help get organized, to dos, lists...havent used all features yet but looking to learn and utilize. U"
The notification and alarm functions don't work.
After the mandatory change from Wunderlost the app worked wothout issue until today. The app signed out of the MS account for some reason and it just kept crashing endlessly and prevented the use of my phone. Why? I also had to sign in multiple times to be able to get it right. Why change it fron Wunderlist to do a worse job? Why break something that was working?
"I'm so happy that I found this app , I've been having problems sleeping at night and for months I couldn't sleep finally I searched up ""Calming"" and this came up , at first I was like ""ugh it's not gonna help"" but now I am so thankful I found this app it's so smoothing and I can grow my trees and listen to calming music! So I fall asleep and my trees grow! Thank you so much for making this all , I love that you can turn off your phone and the app continues to grow my trees and play music!🌳🌲"
"Cancer notifications. I denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound. Now it is impossible to change or mute the sound, no matter what setting I change inside or outside the app, and whether or not I give the app the permissions it wanted. 4 stars when this is fixed."
"I really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks. But a while ago whenever I would open the app, it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if I tapped anything. The rest of my phone still works fine (doesn't freeze) while this happens. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I would love to continue using this app. Thank you! (And I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling.) Edit: Clearing did solve the problem for now. Too bad I had to give up all the progress I made. But thank you anyway, at least I can use the app again."
"This app sucks its slow and they make you pay to make checklists which is 
ridiculous"
"I've been switching between task apps for years, this seems the most intuitive and allows me to be the most productive. Quite a few features are paid for though, and although I would be willing to pay a larger upfront fee, a monthly fee isn't a commitment I'd be willing to make"
"The best habit tracker app I've seen, would've done 5 stars, but I feel like something's missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it"
"Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it. The app tends to be buggy, but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update. Since the last update drag and drop sorting of To Do (and I suspect Dailies as well) subtasks/checklists no longer works which is really frustrating. At least the website works great as always. It's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists."
No reminder for tasks
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well."
only 5 hapits for free
This is a great app and I am getting a lot more done than I was before. The only downside is that the premium subscription is a little pricey for a todo app. Seems like a lot of companies are opting for subscriptions to keep the gravy train coming instead of allowing us to buy the app outright. I'd rather own it outright than pay every year or month.
"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools."
Even after 2 years the sync is still garbage? Wow just wow...
Good app
Nice app but UX can be improved.
good but needs a true Black background option with white letters. dark grey isn't Black
I love pies. Why not make my daily schedule one! Easy to use and links to existing calendars.
"Not a big user, but my use is very satisfactory"
"Happy with the App...but personally I had two issues which are if addressed, may provide sort of convienience to the users. 1. If any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that I felt inconvenient to write the task again. 2. If any task is being feeded and there also undo/redo options are not available"
New version and now I have to wait 30 seconds and watch an ad! Just wanted to take a look at my schedule today. This is unacceptable! 30 seconds!
"A clean and simple app that I've used for a long time now. It's really been helpful for scheduling various errands, tasks and events in my calendar. Its simplicity makes it really easy to use in daily life. Highly recommended."
Terrible
"(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move"
"You're good guys. Your efforts are admirable Please consider making the app 
available to milions of people and support ""rtl""."
Please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot. It serves no purpose if I can't tell what it's for. Get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating. UX should never be an afterthought.
Very good
Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.
I've looked at about every app out there to organize tasks. This is by FAR the best out there. I've not found another with this much flexibility. I actually have not found anything I don't like about the app. Fits my every need. Great job!
"Great app! But have a few suggestions that would make it the best app in the market! Trust me people are looking for this! 1) The ability to add your schedule with a few clicks. For example you can set reoccuring events, but peoples schedules alternate. Would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work. (For reference look at the nursegrid app) 2) add your spouse or family directly. So everything is synced real time.(familywall)"

"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!"
its a great app but need to add a version were you can restore your notes if lost my app got erased by accident and i dont have any of my notes saved please consider adding to the app
this is a super helpfull app. It really motivates me to stay focussed and easily tracks my hours. I would however like to continue growing a tree after a short break in stead planting a new one. I work for short periods of time separated by 5 to 10 minute breaks. As a result I can't grow any trees beyond the first stage. I hope this feature could be added.
Love Planner Pro to keep up with tasks and appointments. Optional alarms for meetings and events are very helpful to keep me on track.
"All to do lists should embrace habit monitoring. Also, I like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed."
Better than todoist! I never thought I'll move away from todoist but it lacked some important features that TickTick has. Got the pro version. It's the only service I'm paying monthly for.
"Can be better, can be made more attractive and everything else is good"
It has helped me to increase my study time from 1to 3 hours in one study lap
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this
"Work well as my need, except it can not be watch face on Samsung watch. I try it several days and love it. So I purchase the pro version, wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with Android. I didn't know that Samsung watch is different OS, so it's incompatible :( However, the developer show responsibility by refunding the money. Anyway, I still hope it will be able to use with Samsung watch soon. Keep up the good work!"
I have been using this app for years. What l especially like is the simplicity of use..
Recurring reminders feature is not available. Let's say I want to do a particular task every day and want to have a reminder daily. I tried for it using this app but it does not work.
phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer
"It's a good app, looks polished and nice. Only problem I have is I have some tasks that repeat themselves even after I complete them, I've editted that they only come once a day but forever stay on the today tasks"
This app is being killed in the background whatever i do. I have given all the permissions. But still it is being killed. My phone is oppo A5. Please do something Devs.
Love it!! Love that it keeps what I did that day forever and crosses it out!! Just like on a piece of paper and you can have a note section!!!
"Might be good, but it doesn't have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it."
Has potential but you gotta pay
"I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!"
I loved this app before but now for some reason notifications do not pop up and I'm missing out on really important reminders.
It's notification tune is frequency low
Its most timewasting app instead! I downloaded this for schedule n it asks to buy a pro version for it! It should be mentioned first before we dwnld this app!
"Whuup, sorry, need to pay for unlimited daily task. Nope"
"I love this app! It's a perfect replacement for my paper calendar. I love that I can have my schedule, meal plan, tasks to do and more all at the tip of my fingers wherever I am. I'm excited for all the plans they have to add even more awesome features!"
"TickTick looks like a powerful and flexible productivity app but I find the help and support information across platforms somewhat overwhelming and confusing. I think that (for the easily confused) it would benefit from a good tidy-up, beginning with a clear conceptual overview of the design philosophy and architecture of the product and the methodology of its use, including flow diagrams and examples, before any specific platform advice."
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.
it is very nice game for studying
"This app is productive but the only annoying thing happened with me is that when I tried to open this app on the next day after downloading it,it was not opening I tried so many times ...."
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others. :(
Good
"Sounds like a wonderful idea for time management, but it won't show half of the things on my calendar and kind of ruins the entire purpose."
"It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package."
"Would be great, but the layout doesn't actually let you succeed in adding 
habits. Thus, useless."
"I subscribed to premium version and it was just working perfect I rate it 5 star but after latest update icon widget is not working. One more issue is there, in agenda view hide declined view option not actually working and declined events are keep showing for the whole day"
Love it! So clean
Love the app! 10/10. Most effective easily in this category.
Just works great app.
Hesitant to buy premium. I feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty. I'm on a budget and if I'm spending $5 I certainly want more bang for my buck. I wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price.
App install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks. So you have to pay to use this app. This is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install.
"Needs to access data on device, events can't be entered manually"
"Great idea, it needs some improvements imo. Edit: after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement. Faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items, you shouldn't have to refresh to see them. That also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh. Etc."
"This Agenda has changed my life. I can easily switch between family, business and personal calendars. I can color code events and the tasks lists have made my followups in business, and my daily home tasks seamless. Im no longer the mom losing my mind (as much anyway). I HIGHLY recommend!!!!"
Everytime I wanted to swap between month /day it lags so much.. If only it was smooth then I am very excited with the app.. I am using lenovo a7-3000
Loved it. Use it to reach and track your set goals.
Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. The health/experience widget doesn't display any information.
"Best one out there. However, I would like to see a swipe feature on the widget to archive or delete as oppose to a button to delete to prevent accidental touching. Turning off auto hide is a bit long winded to delete each task. 5stars if this gets added."
"Have you heard of that saying, ""Where did the time go""? Well this app helps me stay on schedule with my day instead of it just disappearing with nothing accomplished. Love the interface and very user friendly."
so good
Good app for task but should be linked with reminders.
"It was working fine until recently, I bought new bush but when I have successfully planted (it told me it was successful) I saw it planted the last tree I had chosen on previous study session and 4 out of 7 trees were dead (even tho it said I planted 7 successful trees). The notification also doesn't work"
"Amazing app. This really really helps me to increase my productivity, and to keep a note of the things which I need to do. And thank you so much for the cross platform support, I can access my tasks over my pc or anywhere I want. This app solved several problems of mine"
"I didn't understand how to add subtask in ""template"". I pressed ""save as template"", but it saved only the name of template. I couldn't find any information about template in ""help centre"". Please explain me how to add subtask in template."
"I find the app amazing. It is one of the best habit apps that I've used. The only thing I don't like is that I've bought the premium but I don't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I really needed was to have more than 7 habits but, the rest is just decoration. It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them. Another thing that would do this app just perfect, would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer. Other than that, I recommend to download it. Keep doing it so!"
"Excellent way to gamify your personal habits, with many levels of customization so you can set the difficulty levels of tasks as well as the level of self improvement those tasks provide."
"It's a good app but can be better I want the developer to fix the following please: 1-when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2-when you type in it in Persian the symbols like ""?, (,), etc"" doesn't align correctly 3 - if you add some native calendars like Persian calendar to it it will become more useful (and also an option to set it as main calendar not like Google alternative calendars that show Gregorian months not Persian months ex.)"
"Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items."
"Goooodddd benerrrrrr, so helpfulllllll"
"Please keep tinkering, and improving. Thank you for this app"
"Been using this for a long time, tremendous improvements from then up to now. Great job.!"
"I wanted to like this app. It's a very convenient way to see all the info I need right on the screen, but when I click on the task button I get trapped on the task screen with no way back. I have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode."
Helps me stay organized..
"Calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky. Can't see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists. Organize view can't use custom lists to plan my week. The sync with Google is unforgivably poor. If I change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in TickTick. This is so bad I have begun looking for replacement. I would like to see a better support forums for community feedback. Often answers are basically ""suck it up, that's just the way it is""."
Enjoying the app.
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.
I really like this apps cos it allows me to plan weekly schdules which is very important to me.
I love this planner it keeps me on schedule and I can write in Notes to clock hour's
In the latest update the widgets don't work. The app is set to dark mode but the widgets aren't. Also cannot change lists or add to lists through the widget.
"This App is useless , it works as a notepad with your tasks in it , it does not notify you of tasks you suppose to do. When the time reaches it's silent doesn't pop up even though settings have permitted it to pop up and alert , even a simple alarm clock notified me of what to do .This app Doesn't work ."
"Сам сервис очень крутой, но пожалуйста сделайте более понятный интерфейс для «Habits», пусть они они становятся серыми или изчезают, когда человек отметил свой прогресс за день. Я банально не помню, отмечала я свой прогресс сегодня или ещё нет, а показатель в виде цифры или зелёного/рыжего цвета мне ни о чем не говорит."
Good
Track future and historical vary well.
Been using for a week and so far it's the best planner/Todo app I've tried.
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.
"It's easy enough to use as it is, but for a fully paid app, the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless. All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month."
"Slowly but Steadily improve my performance and productivity on learning. Keep all us excited with more features, thank you."
"My biggest problem is that there's no free trail and a lot of stuff is behind the pay wall but I'd like to try before I buy. Also, as a first time user there's a few issues: I downloaded it on my tablet and landscape mode doesn't work well for all pages (especially the habit details page). There was also no tutorial so I was left to just click around (when I later downloaded it on my phone there was a tutorial so I'm not sure why there isn't on my tablet)."
This app so helpful to meet
Great
I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping
"While I love the app and it's customizablity, I have some issues; repeats are confusing and not easy to work about (for instance repeat times during one day and repeat times period), how difficult it is to move tasks to different days, can set specific times on reminders, difficult time building routines versus todos on it, and how hard it is to hide tasks on the calendar that should be hidden in subtasks, change easy to lose, and unable to manually order tasks by preference."
Wow! I love how well it integrates with Google's Home products. Verbally adding items to my various to do lists as well as my grocery list is awesome!!
"It's OK...but NOT free really! Costs 5 bucks to get basoc fratures on/annouying ads off. I don't feel like investing in something that in the end may or may not work out, while there are many systems that could easily replace this app. The 'routines' can be easily called 'recurring tasks' and that feature is offered by almost every respectable calendar app. Free 60 trial period would encourage me, but sneaking in payment under the label of 'free' app is what annoys me on principle! Don't do it!"
This app is perfect for getting work done and is a great way to keep track of progress!
"The best looking todo app I could find, very complete. Would be the one I use but... Unfortunately sync with Google calendar takes hours, up to a day. The issue seems to be a couple of years old (you can check it in the customer section on their website), and nothing was done to address it, while the competition syncs in seconds. If you don't need Google sync, then it's great. I'm now using another app. Sad."
"Free version does what I need, with the exception of undelete when accidentally clicking the wrong thing. However the cost of pro version too much for just that feature"
I used to love this app but since my phone updated it no longer works. I recently uninstalled and re installed I hope it works or I'll have to find something new 🙁
Update: It would make more sense to have the schedule tab as just the schedule layed out where you have the time of day scale to the left ( editable show just hours or hours and minutes) and then the activity from the routine/s at the correct time. And the only way to edit the routine could be only through the routine tab (as thats where I assume you want the main part to edit routines to be). But I love how you can save different routines for each day. Not to sure what programmer is for?
"Wonderful, but please give total version in less amount of price"
"Easy to use, sleek design. Love the funny option for the daily reminders. Keeps me focused."
Perfect works but please add more hours to focus because 3 hours is too short for me. And add Indonesia language.
Many features are available just for premium
Its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be USEFUL and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder.
Why i can't open the room from the link that people share . Every time i have to write the code to join . It's really annoying .
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it"
"I enjoyed using this app for over the past 2 years to improve my life, even if it was by a little bit. The community is kind and friendly. But I think it would be better if you could filter out what type of guild you want to join. I don't want to spend too much time scrolling down just to find the right guild."
Wish it didn't force me to use Google calendar. I wanted to start a new calender off of this app
"I think i found my perfect to do app! I'm pleased that I was able to use the same features I was using from an old app and do it on this one, plus more! It's so easy to organize and visualize all your tasks. The appearance of the app overall is excellent."
always freezing
Widget keeps reverting to my day. It didn't before. Also now often unresponsive. This change is incredibly frustrating. Please fix bugs then happy to upgrade review rating as otherwise us good. Thank you
"Not able to show the notification after the time is up. Also, it is not able to function well on counting the exceeded time or shown incorrectly. It would be of great help if you could fix the problems. Thank you:)"
"I like this app, because it fits well in my daily routines and offers very many settings, especially regarding appearance. It has some basic design flaws and misses some easy opportunities, but all in all it is a valuable application for my personal time management."
With the latest update it seems that when I update the frequency for one task it messes up the frequency and repeat days of the week for another task which is annoying as I was using the app to track my weekly tasks
Why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar? I don't want this private app to access my Google calenders and phone calender. Instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app. I'm deleting this. The UI is great. But I don't want you to link with my private apps.
"I tried hundreds of apps and thousands of ways for being focused, nut nothing helped me then I found this app and I am staying focused. This is the best one."
"Its a wonderfull app, helps in keeping a track of your habits and how consistent you are with it"
"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)"
This is worst task game in my life
Crashes all the time
"Quality, very helpful, when busy, helps track tasks and keeps dates passed as well."
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.
Helpful and easy to use. Really good app for students or people who struggle with remembering tasks they have to get done.
"Thank you for responding and I'm looking forward to that update (customized categories). Another improvement I'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one, such as save $100 per week, etc. I got the Premium and love the dark theme, this app is the best I've found for my needs. Thank you!"
"Reminder sometime not working, so i must restart the reminder. Please fix it"
"Very useful, great clock widget with my schedule. It is better if can open calendar app by touched widget."
"I paid only a few bucks for premium, and now I have it for life. I love it!"
"I had a problem with upgrading to Premium. They were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away. It's a good app for those familiar with the Franklin Covey system, and syncs well across devices."
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking."
Perfect
"Recurence tasks does not work properly, otherwise I would give 4 starts."
"Find a new app. Overall if you havent noticed, the dev's left this app. As of recently, the servers are dead. This means you cant make an account, forums are gone, motivation pictures gone, etc. Find a new app,"
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review
"Great helping app, would be 5 if events won't disappear occasionally, possibly because calendar is shared between two gmails"
"The app keeps crashing every day, and wouldn't open. Every morning I got to reinstall it and log in again... What's wrong..."
"App is so much good , best app , i want to give 5 star but not giving so that u can notice me . After its update ,my app is not opening il, if i reinstall it , my coins will lost and trees also . Please help me what to do"
"I'm in love with the app. It motivates me a lot and really helps to stay on track. Apart from the cool gamified features, it also has a huge and very friendly community, where you can get support and answers to pretty much any questions."
I like this app but it's always saying it has stopped on my phone
"Jury is still out.....would be more than happy to review.....if i was actually given the time to do so before the ""rate me rate me"" messages."
Love it! Thanks
The tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand I have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
"[1] Pls put additional sounds like instrumental music, campfire, etc. [2] an option where you can study unlimited and stop it anytime you want and still get coins [3] If the tag is changed DURING the planting process, it should reflect separately the time spent by the previous tag as well as that of the new tag so that the overall distribution is at its peak accuracy. Will put 5 stars afterwards."
"Very good at what it does, but doesn't come close to warranting a monthly charge."
Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.
"After years using Wunderlist we move on. It works. The thing missing to me is that I can not get a simple view that shows items overdue, due today, coming up in the next week . I need to look in multiple views. I have the usability issue of having to fiddle with it to toggle between today, this week, overdue, etc. I can not default to a view that gives me the information I need at a glance. I suppose I can look at ""all"" but that gives a never ending list. For me, this is a step backwards."
"bought premium version, didn't get upgrade, sent proof of payment, still no response. not good"
As I am a regular user of this app...This app needs some update like the calendar based listing method. People will go to date and list the task...Another problem is so many color for list. It's annoying... Who don't like colors they can select one color for every task list... That is all...🙂🙂🙂
Awesome app.
"Perfect, I'm loving every element so far ,I love that I can at some point once it's all done use it like my paper planner and sync them with my phone, I hate carrying my paper planner and also having to update my cell calendar , I love and cant wait to see and use all the coming soons I'm so excited ,I'm hoping also a widget will be something to come soon as well so that I can have it open on my phone and not always have to open the app for quick reference. Keep it up"
Hi I like this app 😍 it could be better if the todo list's tasks were sorted by their deadline and also today's tasks had a different color!! And a reward could be a game which needs some coins to play them! Thank you!!
I like the design and ease. Best habit tracker I've found.
I really love this app 👍
"I unistalled just for the costumer service. I was ready and willing to give the app a shot. But given the cruel, uncaring, and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works I will be uninstalling imediately."
Very easy to use. Definitely recommend.
"Helped me make a streak! I am a person who starts an activity with excitement but loses interest eventually, most likely before a week. But this app made me continue because i had to punch everyday. When i crossed 4 days it felt like I should not let it go to waste,let me continue. And then activity like drinking 3L of water everyday was easy to achieve. So when i made a one-week streak of that, the app congratulated me and built more excitement. Rest is history! 💛"
"Only day one but WOW. It's dumb how distracted we get from our phones. This has kept me focused for 45min study sessions during they day, with 30 min breaks. The material I'm studying is so dry so this really helps. If it keeps working I'll upgrade to premium. Also downloaded the night version. Keep up the good work!!!"
"Easy to use App, easy to move items up and down the list and organize categories. Like this app better than the Wunderlist app I used to have."
"In general, the app is confusing. Repeating tasks work for some time and then stop working. I have not found any clear logic behind this. The same problem was with wunderlist. Not recommended."
"I'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized. I have tried series of productivity apps before. Apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for; integration with other apps which I love. Two things I found disappointing, features are extremely limited without premium, it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive. I couldn't find statistics; from totally hours and other reports"
Please allow line wrap for a event tile in the month widget and/or month-style display
Elevates your productivity. Very neat and organized app
"My favorite habit-gamification app so far, after trying a few. Definitely minimalistic compared to Habitica, but it makes up for it in just being more functional, and with a much better system for attaching relative value/importance to various habits/to-do tasks/etc. All habit apps face the fact that it's hard to put actual numbers to how much a good habit should be ""worth"", and that scoring points you set can feel a bit like digging up treasure you buried. Do It Now handles it all well, tho"
i like the idea of planting trees and making a forest..which is really satisfaying. But this app doesn't notify me when the timer is up and it's time for break.. i have to check if the timer is still running and then set the break myself..which is the worst part! and it doesn't allow me to set multiple timer with breaks in between! if they can fix these issues..it would be a useful app
...And more!
"It works! Does what it's supposed to do, although I don't require any features other than setting an appointment/event, and being reminded of it. Unobtrusive, even when using it as a free version only. I'll probably upgrade to PRO just to reward the developer. Edit: The new 30 second ads really screw this up."
"I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for years as it was one of the best calendar apps, but now the obtrusive video ads that hold you hostage have completely changed the experience. I finally had to uninstall it because it's to the point where it's just too much. I'm understanding about banner ads if you don't want to buy the Pro version, but this is unacceptable."
"The app is good but a FAQ would be appreciated. For example, I cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks."
Good
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!
"It's actually good but then stopped working effectively since a week ... suddenly it stops and I couldn't open it...so, had to uninstall and install many a times, I also lost all my productivity due to it's sudden shutdown...mine is a pro version too..this is so bad and testing our patience.. please fix the issue.! Thankyou."
"The app itself is great, but they've started adding unskippable ads. It locked my phone and forced me to go through an ad disguised as a video game where I had to shoot criminals just to make an appointment. I had no problem with static ads to support the developers, but locking my phone until I played a dumb game ruined the app for me."
"Worst app I have ever used, it doesn't do anything."
Haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far. I LOVE that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day. I just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes. That would make this a 5-star review.
"Worked really well, however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re-added. . . Eevveerryy day. won't remember to actually use it without the widgets, so its useless now. not worth paying extra."
"why do not work reminders repeated monthly at all? one-time yes, repeated no. what is wrong?"
"I got this app to setup a schedule to work from home, and it's been good for that. I just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day. The widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen. The app could do to look a bit more modern. But all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late? Every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late (i.e. reminder set to 2:00PM, notification arrives at 2:03PM, etc.). Developers?"
"The app is good, but there are glitches. After some time when the person tries to open the app. It showed to clear the data of the app. This deletes all the storage of the app the coins collected, the forest made. This leads to the disruption of the person's analysis of their focussed work. Hope you'll soon rectify this error. And hope the soon comes early."
"this was a great idea in theory, but I want a standalone app that doesn't pull calendar data from some other app. for me and for how I wanted to use this app to manage my schedule, this just won't work. I think it could also be more user-friendly. a shame, since this really is an amazing, unique idea. devs, I hope you keep working on this and take this as constructive criticism. I would love to try this app again if things change and it becomes a more flexible standalone calendar."
Pretty good reminder app. The recurring reminders don't seem to work very well though. I'll get a reminder for the first occurrence and then nothing for any of the following events. There doesn't appear to be a way to acknowledge the original alarm without deleting it or marking the entire series as complete.
I was looking for a class schedule app and this was not it
Should have an option to add reminders. it only displays events
I have not been using app for very long. Therefore the 3 star rating. After some use I will return to rate again.
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist."
"Everything is perfect, except for the fact that daily reminders on habit check feature doesn't work."
"Beutiful and easy to use once you get used to it however I wished creating 
an event was a bit more simple and quick. Update: no longer syncs to my 
calender and the dates are all messed up....too bad I loved it"
Excellent app
Nice app but doesn't really have what I'm looking for.
"Confusing without a lot of explanation on what is what. Might be good when I figure it out, but it's not a real intuitive app and has a figure it out curve."
"Seems like a really awesome app, but blocks stuff behind a subscription or a buy all one time payment. Would rather pay piece meal. It also has ads in the free version that you can't get rid of without the sub or $50 buy all."
As someone who has eternally struggled to build and maintain habits this has made it so easy for me. I've had the app about a week (upon writing this review) and already I'm remembering my habits without prompts. I absolutely intend to buy the full version when possible and I have already recommended the app to multiple friends of mine. Absolutely great app.
It's a quite useful program. Works reliably.
You have to pay for all the decent features... There's nothing you want to do that your alarm doesn't already do
"SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists"
"I totally recommend this app. It had help me on every possible way. It's really helpful if you really want to develop a new habit. I specialy like the easyness to configure the habits and the reminders; the motivational notes that you can find around are just right. But its true that is not a magic app, PLEASE if you want to create a new habit, you have to work for it, you have to work to create something. If you do that, you'll see the true colors of this magnificent app. Be true to yourself."
auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.
Not user friendly. Almost impossible to delete or edit lists. Format is garbage.
I have so many things in the writing in the lists :D
It doesn't reset or set you reminders but it helps
"After testing the app for a while, I was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on Android. Do you know when it would be available? Also, is there a one time fee purchase option? Is there a GMAIL integration feature? Like Google Tasks? I like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app 👍. Nice work on the Widgets 👍. Thanks 🙂"
Great feature is reminder to reorganize missed and undone tasks. But ui of the app looks confusing to me. I cat find a way to add tasks easyly enought gor me. i dont know what next. google tasks are simplier and todoist have limited features in free version.
"This is the free version. The paid version is $7.99, the Platinum version is even more. You can only track 5 habits in the free version. Developers must be paid, but a lack of up front honesty makes this product undesirable. (I should charge for this.) Do not install. #doughymiddle"
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle
"It's just an ordinary built-in timer, with enhanced graphics, which doesn't notify at the completion of duration set. No other purpose it serves."
"Awesome app! Smart natural language syntax support for task management, cool UX and multi-device sync."
Another perfect mobile application ! Should send competitors teams to UI/UX design board. Excellent/perfect (hard) work !
The concept is good. But why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though I have turned the notification on? This is very bad.
The app is not upto the mark 1. Notification window is not there 2. Chat window is not available on every task
"This is a good app.... but the only problem is I cant use it properly.... because if I have planted a tree and come back to plant another one.... or to use any option in the app, I cant do it. It shows that ""unfortunately forest has stopped "".... there is no problem with my phone.... please repair this problem.... I liked the app.... but this problem is just annoying me...."
Features are good but i strongly recommend you to not install this app. Waste of time. Without any reason they freezed my account two times in one night.
I loved the franklin planners and this is as close as it comes so good job
"Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap."
"App is completely broken. Can't even make an avatar -- none of the options show up. Also, get an error message when trying to show a display name"
osm app but now its update an I am not able to see my all reminders that I use to remind my self before uninstalling the app
Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.
"I wanted to like it... I've always drooled at the idea of having a to do list app integrate with a calender. But alas, this version is clunky. You can't delete a single date of a recurring calender event, meaning you can't flexibly plan your day while beginning with a rough outline. I switched over to to-doist and Google calender instead."
"earlier this was a very good apps, suit for me and my activities. But after I installed it on my PC & change my password, the apps on my phone keeps telling me to reset password from web (even though I already did it) :( so now I can't use it on my phone coz every time I try to open the apps, it always making my phone restart"
"Nice idea, but internal app organisation is a mess where you can easily miss a task due for today"
Looks like a pretty good app but it doesn't sync with Alexa. Which is the main reason I installed it. Shouldn't be this difficult.
"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks."
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this."
A very intelligent timetable app with amazing design. Totally recommended.
"it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task"
"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work."
Feature request: 1. undo delete or bin option 2. option to adjust snooze period (remind me tmrw mrng for eg.) 3. Option to add milestone to tasks so that it will be easy to keep track of the its progress. 4. Pls add option to change the default timings like 9am 2pm etc. 5. Also while adding a task itself please give option to 'remind me after 30 mins etc' instead of going through date and time adjustment.
Awesome App that has really kept me on track. I just wish there was some type of reward system once you've reached your goal. I think regular reminders (perhaps with some form of motivation attached to it) would also encourage discipline and drive.
Its efficient and so simple to us!
It is easy. Would love to have more sort options. But I keep a lot of lists and keeps me organized.
"Really? $8 for a habit tracker? There are other apps that do the same thing for far less money. I don't mind paying for apps, but this seems like price gouging. Oh, and it's $10 if you want the ability to export your data!"
C'est très bien... mais ça devrait être moins lourd en daya
"DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional."
Necessary. Needs a little more life and interaction to its graphics
Looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars. It only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar.
No Outlook Calendar support. Most business people use Outlook...
The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer."
"Great all around GTD, Tasks, Reminder. A few that I would like to to see added: 1) add location icon WHEN setting a reminder. 2) In calendar view, a better view showing of the difference between a task and a calendar event. 3) a dedicated shortcut (activities) or widget to add a task by voice."
"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help"
Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!
Works well
"If it wasn't for the fact that the app doesn't offer separate widgets for Work Profile (I personally really need this), I'd give it 5 stars :)"
"Huge amount of functionality in free version. stopped short of 5* because duplicate functionality v limited. When i duplicate tasks I cannot duplicate to any other location than current one and cannot change name, and the new name is set as old name plus ""copied"". Would be very helpful to have duplication functionality that I can copy tasks (or indeed a whole list) and on copying them can have the duplicates placed where I wish and make choice about naming convention"
The app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working. I have bought the pro version.
Bug report - App Alerts I use both Android app (installed on Android 10) & web access. If i solve a task on web access the app also shows closed task. But I still get a push notification for the closed task on Android device
Helped me a lot
"very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock."
"So many portions of the app we're not appearing on the screen from the get go, including the first two screens entirely, and even the avartar selections."
Amazing app. I use it everyday and I feel that my life is more organized.
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc"
"I already have a subscription, it's ridiculous that It notices I already had a free trial so it obviously knows my account but its not logging me in with my premium subscription. To top it off I can't ask customer service nothing because it's not an option unless you have the premium that's ridiculous."
"Great To Do list. The only issue is location based reminders seem to be sporadic. Also annoying that you can't set all day tasks, hopefully an update soon. No resolution and tech support slow, a shame."
"Good design, simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details. However, they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year. Seems like this project was abandoned."
This is the reason I get straight A's I'm continuing with my studies and doing well in these times.The only problem I have is that once you get use to the rain sounds make focus it takes a WHILE to get use to another sound but in conclusion I really LOVE this app ❤️
"Overnight events (ie 8pm-4am) show up as All Day events in the calendar. If they are repeating, then two All Day events are shown.  Need to fix this ASAP!"
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.
Needs smart dictation like todoist and better calendar widgets like ticktick
"This is so, soooo useful! I love too much to use just ordinary words. Keep doing the good stuff! Y'all rock ~"
Thanks for ruining Wunderlist you jackasses
Tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re-open. Can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription
"Great. Better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or ""all"" view, despite priority or reminder time. That option is what sets it above. Wish that android reminders were full screen, however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time. View in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns"
"Bought the pro a few years ago. However, recently went to a new phone, and now I'm seeing ads, and it doesnt look like I have the pro version anymore. Not sure what happened but jacked up that I paid for the pro, and unable to get the functionality of the pro version without buying it again."
Good
İntuitive and straightforward approach to calendar.
Want use only not sharing
"This todo list app definately stanfs above the almost the same todo_wonderlist_tasks type of app. I love its flexibility to make your own processes, love the integration of other calendars, love the preset lists, and most importantly i love the widget! I can make a todo list widget on one screen, and my shopping list widget on the other. Plus I can make each lines super tight to see the list without to constantly scrolling up and down. Great app."
I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.
the app looks great. alot of function. it wouldn't show me any shared calenders. fix that and this is a top app
Love it so far. Wish it had a widget for Android though.
"No doubt it’s the best productivity app. It is very smooth and customizable. I liked the idea of adding a Pomo Timer & Habit tracker. Having all this features made this app unique & amazing. But the prize of the premium package is little high, that's why i'm not gonna give you 5 Stars. Anyway, it’s a great app 🔥"
"Very Helpful, The Best Yet !"
"I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called ""sleep"" just to keep it on the graph"
Paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again
"Very good. Simple and easy to use. I would like to see more statistics, because for now I can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time, but not a overall statistics."
Never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring DO NOT show in calendar even though you sync this information.
"A great app for making tasks. But, if you could add the alarm system and planning the schedule for free users, then it would be really nice...."
"Seems like a good idea but the widget is invisible. It is there, I can see the edges when I try to move it but it's completely invisible. I tried decreasing the widget transparency and deleting cache but to no avail. Devs, any clues? Thank you"
Please bring syncing with pc.
Ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
"beginning setup wasn't loading at all. signed up using Facebook. since it was not loading, i just clicked next. now I'm stuck with my Avatar with no way to change"
You can't even create an account without a purchase of the app. It costs $2.49 to make an account? EDIT: Thanks for replying
Best organizer out there. Easy to use and has an intuitive layout.
"I would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my Huawei p20, unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything, I tried removing the widget and re-doing it, now it doesn't even show my lists, and I have to go into the app to check or add things, which of course means once I'm done with the current ones I'll delete it. A task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful..."
"I would give this app 5 stars, but if you press ""silence notifications,"" you can never turn them back on."
Wonder full
"Kept crashing, rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was HUGE and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping.. I'm out.. UPDATE: No I can't send a feedback (with log) as I've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app.. and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data"
i cant set my times for events bc theres no am/pm option. it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing..annoying
"Sync doesn't work despite having a lifetime premium account, as others have said."
"sub tasks should be possible to leave unticked - for instance I might have put the bins out, but not replaced bin bags. on your apo, if I tick the main task, it assumes I have done the sub task."
The ios app is lot better than this. please improve it as soon as possible.
I Love how easy it is to navigate the app and all its features as well as being able to stay organized with multiple project on the go is made very easy now!
"This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ... Hence the 4 stars , connecting to a student service such as UniDays would increase influx of student users."
"I installed and then uninstalled it. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to edit day-by-day deviations from a routine. So I can set up a routine, but then have no way to track how well I followed it, day by day (for instance, exercised for half an hour instead of an hour, or started late, or missed it completely, or did things out of order). Am I missing something?"
"It would help me a lot if it could silence the notification from other apps 
when I'm studying"
"The best habit tracker app I've seen, would've done 5 stars, but I feel like something's missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it"
"Fine app. Would be perfect to have desktop web version also, to make adding routine much easier."
"I wanted to give the app more stars as I love the concept, but it's so buggy. Especially with the dailies feature... all the dailies are linked together somehow. There are some things I do Mon-Sat for instance, but not on Sundays. But when I set a task to not repeat on Sunday, it sets all tasks that way. Very frustrating."
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited."
"No matter what I do, even setting 'no notifications' when creating event or task; they  continually pop up. Not happy with this feature."
"This app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks, but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval. For example, every two weeks, or every 5th of the month. There is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month, but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences. This was unfortunately a dealbreaker."
EDIT/UPDATE - Purchased premium. Sync doesn't work. A quick glance at developers FB/Twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth (no activity since 2018). App hasn't received an update since 2018. My suggestion: pick an app that's still actively developed. Exactly what I have been looking for. Fantastic interface and thoughtful design. I'm hooked guys!
"I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!"
Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran
Great but basic in design and you cant not preview things such as sound. Its basic to use but some features are a little annoying like all the tags in one place. Id like the option to categorise.
Not able to buy plants. Unable to sign in.
"The app is pretty good, but I wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in. I tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but I still lost health for not completing it daily. It would be nice to be able to put repeating tasks on the app that you don't do every day, but repeat on a schedule, like laundry every Sunday or something."
"Navigation needs work: you can only navigate with the many buttons in the app, the back button closes the app. Feature request: Has weekly and monthly report, would like a daily report to share with an accountability partner Also, would be great to generate report based on category."
the free version is pretty minimal.
When I started using the app it was good .... But now it keeps on crashing and it says to delete the record/history and also right now I am trying to open it but thats not happening and I have to uninstall it and again install it..this has happenend with me for around 3-4 times.. Can anyone help?
Very disappointed that you have a very limited amount of habits and you require premium to be removed. I feel it should be lifted!
"I like this app very much to create a schedule for everyday and having the reminders. Haven't found any other app which perfectly fits my requirement like TimeTune. But I am always facing the issue where I stop receiving the intimation and have to ""Refresh background apps"" which is very annoying. Hope I can receive support for this issue."
It's assistance on screen seems to display the wrong resolution when using widgets
"Nice. Will be better if app has got inhabit counter.. for example count of pushups or exercise. I need it, but app is very nice. I will be recommend it."
"Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar"
"The alarm sound doesn't work, so i could not know it already the time..."
"Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily."
Liked wunderlist better
I loved this app when I used it 2 years ago but can I no longer log in?
"It's completely broken, things don't show up, error codes from the very beginning, it's just broken"
Improve my quality of concentration...
I'm a courier at a law firm and this ap is perfect for organizing deliveries.
"After installing the app, i check to see if my reacurring event would show up. And it did that one time. So minutes after i insalled i had to let it go."
Very easy to use the interface is very good and rookie
"Yeah i love this app. Inspired by the idea. Try planting a tree when you are havings stuffs to do, but you seem to be wasting time scrolling. That would be the real way of utilizing the app. And youve got different trees to grow :). Kudos to the creator."
"I had a 180 minutes timer and when I was about to give up I saw that ""0 tree's""🌲 will be dead.. hence I gave up, only to see 1 tree die.. I am really looking forward to not seeing this bug again. And also I was able to access my parallel space apps."
Impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist. Thank you for screwing my wunder-lists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password
"Very happy with Todoist after trying various. Easy to pick up and the nice widgets to display and quick add have very quickly become part of my routine, and stuck. Others have lacked smoothness in that area, best I've tried."
"i like how its organized and how many choices and the customization. but, i set alarms and keep in mind, i have all permissions on, and it didnt go on my screen, so i missed a very important meeting."
"At fırst it seems complicated, bu after some days you will find it handy and usefull"
"Seriously, this app is easy to use yet so useful. The workflow is smooth and user friendly, thumbs up."
"Simple and easy to use! The widget is fantastic and easy to read for a 50 year old trying to organize. No ads and free! I must say, i loaded at least 8 apps before i found this one and none of them compare. If you want an app that allows you to put tasks that you need to get done in an in your face format this is it!"
Great app but needs work.
"Honestly, one of the most brilliant apps to use if you need help focusing on work. You'll not regret using this app!!!"
It work absolutely fine but why every hour try to connect with Facebook servers? Adguard noticed it
"I can say this is a nice app! I often see this app on so many study videos. But i just start to use this app now and when i plant the tree, i can still open other apps and the tree didn't die...please help"
Godd
"fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part ."
Love the way it can be easily zoomed for both size and number of days.
a very productive app. but mine kept crashing and I had to reinstall twice. couldn't keep up with progress.
Go overall application. I wish it was easier to make changes in already established recurring appointments and it would be nice to have a refresh button. Everything else works really well.
Good app
I try to write somthing and it exits
"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed..."
"I constantly get a message "" problem with the server "" please fix this, I liked the app a lot but I am unable to use it cause it doesn't connect nor update my tasks"
Full screen ads. 0/5 Edit : raised to 3/5.
Bad reviews are a real turn off for me.
So good
"This is a good planner because it's easy to use and understand, but the widget consumes a lot of the phone's battery."
"I kept getting empty screens when opening the app, so I pressed skip. Filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where I couldn't see my character or the build options. I could select things like body or hair, but nothing appeared relating to that."
"Too complicated, wanted to use to strategize for my exam but it was to difficult to add a task."
Great app and the only flaw I see is that you can't yet export your data. Please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so I can save my entries forever
"I tested a few task apps, and this one looked promising at first. But very quickly I hit the paywall, even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels. I'm going to use Trello instead."
I liked how I could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps (I had to input myself) and my notifications would only go off if I opened the app myself. Kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications...
Terimakasih sudah membantu
"Linking tasks to higher level skills & characteristics, and then seeing them increase, is perfect motivation for me."
"I liked this app in its previous form, but they have been reducing options. One of my favorite thing was the repeat by minutes option. It's gone."
Stephen...can 2 people share a task list on their respective phones?
Good
"Worst app,, Now I just know that only 5 habit can track freely , there above premium, also payble Back up, But Developer are never inform first....."
"So disappointed to lose everything. I didn't realize the app didn't save your lists. Got a new phone and everything transferred but because this app doesn't have you log in, everything is gone. I had several important lists saved to prepare for my upcoming baby and it's all gone. I'll never remember it all. Time to look for something else to use. Response: From the main screen I didn't see any prompting so did not know I was supposed to or how to."
"You receive silent notifications or sometimes you don't even receive them and continue working on smth, which loses the reason you downloaded the app."
"The text on the notes always gets messy, specifically if you have spaces in between paragraphs or using links. Always gets messed up. Sentences move up and delete the first letters of the paragraphs. Really annoying."
"I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for. Unless I missed how/where to do them, there are three things I wish I could do in the app. First, create custom categories/subcategories, especially under health. Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes."
"Great UI, but there are concerns with adding tasks to my day page everyday is annoying and it would be helpful if it syncs with Google Calendar and includes tasks and reminders from it on the my day page."
"I was a customer of Any.Do for a while and on March 2020 i clearly asked them NOT to renew my subscription as i found a different company to provide me task manger services - Todoist. More than that - i even consult with Any.Do technical support team how to transfer my database to Todoist and over the phone, i ALSO remind them to cancel it. I received the cancellation notice and I DID NOT ask them to renew/continue any of Any.Do services. More than that - i also have the Invoice from the company i moved my services, Todoist, for the same period of time that Any.Do charged me for. After i tried to contact Any.Do they refused to refund me. Therefore, i let you and everybody to know that I WILL NOT USE ANY OF ANY.DO services anymore and recommend everyone that read this post DO NOT USE ANY.DO SERVICES or you taking a big risk that something like that will happen to you as well."
This is Demo Only
"Great app. I like how I can rearrange the list easily. Also the someday, upcoming and tomorrow categories are just what I need when something spring's to mind."
Is there any ways to see your progress in graphic? Like daily task you've done and see it in graphic stats or something? Because i can seems to find one in the apps or did i miss something? I wsnt to know and compare my tasks daily. The UI and everything is good tho except for that graphical stats daily i cant find one here dev
Wow this is what i was exactly looking for. Bought premium on the first day. Add many more features in the coming updates
"Tried it out. The time function, which is 90% of the app IMHO, is clunky. The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day. This app was, for me, ironically, a waste of time."
Very helpful in staying focused on a work. I mainly use this during studying to stay focused and to track the amount of time I have spend. Is a wonderful app.
"Paid premium, it doesn't sync at all. Costumer service unresponsive for a long time. Don't spend money on Premium, this app is dead, the last update was in 2018"
Everything is a premium feature. Everything else is a basic list
"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?"
I really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs. The first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too. After updating the app it was still the same. (Im using a samsung s8 if thats important) Hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app.
"The recent update has changed everything I liked about this app. In my ""task"" view I manually have to select overdue/today/tomorrow/this week in order to see the corresponding tasks. In the previous version I had the ability to see all of them and hide the tasks which weren't relevant. I should be able to see multiple lists at the same time, and this filter just doesn't let me. I want to see my ""overdue"" and ""today's"" planned task in one view. That's the most important for me."
It's hard to understand how it works
This app is amazing
I loved the app so much . It is amazing and helps me a lot organize my ideas.. I think if it had the option to put our tasks in order and the option of setting timer it would be very organized and irreplaceable.
It worked perfectly for me and benefits me with fantastic pleasures!!
There are full-size ads that block your entire screen. Incredibly disruptive and I don't want to reward that by buying pro. There are other calendar apps out there that don't deliberately disrupt your productivity.
"Limited use so far, every time I i touch the calendar icon the app changes to calendar but will not revert back to watch face unless i uninstall and reinstall no back button"
"This is fun and cool it would be 5 stars but you know what habitica WE DIE SO QUICKLY WE LITTERALLY LOG IN (ME AND MY PARTY) AND WE ARE DEAD BECAUSE SOMEONE DIDNT LOG IN THAT DAY, ALSO THERE SHOULD NOT BE BOSS DEALING DAMAGE IT DEALS MORE DAMAGE THEN I DEAL TO IT, THE HEALERS HEAL 6 HEALTH OUT OF 50 AND USE 25 MANA POINTS MY TEAMATE JUST USED ALL OF THEIR MANA TO TRY AND KEEP ALIVE AND I DO THEN I CHECK OFF MY DAILIES FROM YESTERDAY AND I DIED AND I DEALT 11 BOSS DEALT 14 PLS FIX TEAM AGREES FIX"
"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful."
It would be great if the notifications actually works!! I don't get notified by any task I put in at all
"This is the app I've been looking for but there's still room for improvement. First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry. Second there is a lack of flexibility. There should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves."
I was using this app for years and I'm used to it but those ads are so annoying. It's sad for me to look for other options. You should leave those ads out
If you like a simple app to get the job done...this is it.
Very effective!
Add seamless integration for office 365 accounts..
Doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore. No way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar
This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time)
"Great app that now has intrusive full screen ads, ugh"
Anything beyond keeping a simple list (including reminders) is paid
Works very well for me. Very helpful because I can see what I prioritized for work and for my business days before.
"Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme."
"This is my first time rating this app because I noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder. Hopefully after the task tab, the time & date will be under it. It's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses I didn't notice it for several times. Also,I don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people ;so it should not be the priority. I hope that you can do something about this. Anyway, thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks.I'll wait for another update"
Fix permissions for 5 stars. Great design and UI but you shouldn't need access to my contacts to login with my Google account. Google provides an API for it that all other apps use without contacts permissions.
Pretty good overall. Notifications and reminders do not work most of the time.
"limits habits to like 6 or whatever unless you pay, useless"
Gd
I don’t know why it missed some alarm. UI design is great. But i missed some imp task cause of this missed alarm prob
"I really liked the app but suddenly from nowhere all of my data were gone. One second they were fine then when I connect to the internet, it's back at lvl 0 with the Johnny avatar.  It seemed that there was no way to get my data back. Dropbox saved data seemed to have been overwritten so idk what to do. I feel betrayed being immersed in the apo then suddenly left hanging with the fact that I don't even know what caused it."
"Aww man glad I found this!!! Love rpg games and this is a great incentive to get stuff done, just wish the full version wasn't almost 60 bucks or a subscription fee... Lil much for a reminder app"
This is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me. I found a free app that does tbe same things.
"I gave it a lower rating because lately if I had any repeat scheduled appointments, I can't change one without changing them all. Very aggravating. Before, I was able to cancel one without affecting all the future repeat weekly or monthly entries. Before, I could use this calendar to keep track of my past activities. Now it looks like I attended a meeting when I didn't because I couldn't cancel it without affecting future meetings"
I will reinstall this app
"It ok, gets boring after a while"
Ease of use. Everything at your fingertips. Even I can't forget something.
"Why on earth would you create an app that doesn't link with your calendar??? The To Do app is straightforward on Android app and desktop version. HOWEVER, there's no way to link it to Microsoft 365 Calendar! It's within the same suite of Microsoft 365 and yet, you can't schedule on either one to show up on the other. That's asinine! ! You would think this would be a primary feature, but the Product Manager must be sleep at the wheel. It's mystifying."
"Not able to get rewards in rewarded ad . Also the app gets crashed every alternate day , have to reinstall and log in every single time"
"Awesome habit tracker, I like that you can go back in time to track a habit you've already started."
"Worked great at first but continously does not sync completely with Alexa. I only use this app as a shopping list with Alexa, but when it only shows 4 of 10 items on my list it's pretty useless. The purpose of the list is so that I don't have to remember the 10 items I told Alexa to add to the list (which show up on todoist)"
"Hello! Your app is amazing! My GF and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other. But i really need a list functional, like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app. Are you going to add this? Sry for my English, btw:) UPDATE: And i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it's completed. Thank you and your team again for this great app!"
"love the app,any chance we'll be getting an iOS version of it too? and be able to sync everything across all devices (maybe even a desktop version of the app)"
"Idk what happened, but from the start app was just alright, and it was very nice and I was happy that i found it. But since a few hours it just stopped working! When I'm trying to complete the task it just doesn't count. The mark is appears, but several seconds later it vanishes!!! And also when I'm trying to complete a part of assignment it doesn't count. Please fix :("
🖤IT
"I wish it had a widget, but I love it otherwise."
"Love the program and it's definitely an improvement over Google Calendar. Just the easy moving back and forth between dates using the 'go to' feature is a huge plus in my book. It does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least. I use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists. I save them in the Description field. First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a"
Always a good thing! Great! Wonderful!
"Truly dark mode is needed (amoled) (when I open a task, the ""dark theme"" is gray. Not black FULLY BLACK)."
Great reminder for me! Love it
"If you want something that syncs to your calendar, you are in luck! It really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea. However my 3 star review comes from the fact you can't use it without syncing to your calendar, and there by having it affect your calendar. I was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool, much like a block system, but I can't have it be that AND have my calendar be a place for just appointments. It makes the actual calendar look too full and messy. Basically in short, can you please add an offline tool as well?"
start crashing right after 2 days..but the idea is good
"it's better to have biweekly schedule. Im using this app to manage my to do list, unfortunately, it doesnt have every other week schedule or biweekly schedule. to be honest i have lot of things to do during that schedule because my oayout is every other week so i really need to have that kind of schedule. olease add that up. thank you."
just installed Love that syncs with google. Wish the mobile app allowed Screen rotation. Wish I could Zoom on the week a month view. I understand mobile i in beta. Looking forward to the evolution.
"Best app ever, haha"
"One week of use & I purchased a subscription. I've used other similar apps, I enjoy this the most. There a few improvements needed, so I need to add suggestions to the Reddit page. I spent time & wrote out what I value in life, what my aspirations are, & then I narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations. Then I added my goals to this app. So far it's easy to keep track of my goals, habits, & how I'm doing. It's incredibly easy & even fun to use. Thank you for this app."
"The tracker itself is not bad but I set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them. I already checked my settings, all is good. It's nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working."
"It's a good app, no question about it but it's not perfect. I used it for months after abandoning todoist but I'm leaving Ticktick now. It's feature packed but not as polished as other products. The UI is not great and the app has very different design language as well as features depending on which device you open it on. This lack of consistency as well as poor natural language support doesn't make it the perfect ToDo app."
"I used this app a few times, but now, Facebook login won't work. It'd be a better app if you could just sync it with your Google account."
You literally have to buy premium for it to remind you. Like that defies the purpose of the app. Just go use Tick Tick instead. Its free version has more features than this Todoist's premium version.
"Setting up late events (past 11pm) is literally impossible. Start and end times/days will shift randomly when I make a change to the other.  Whenever I do manage to get both right, I get a ""Same time"" error even though clearly the start and end times are different."
"I downloaded this app on my photo and it works great! But I just downloaded on my tablet for school and even though I used the same account, none of my events were there. It didnt sync right. I tried to restart, nothing. This app is good, just not for multiple devices."
"Ok concept, but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level. Kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of AI with suggestions for every parameter, and sync between different devices, to get the basic functionality into usable state."
Please add archiving for stagnant dailies
"To be honest, it's a really good app. It has everything (simplicity, system, ui, etc.) but seriously, if this is really a productivity app, it needs to have an offline mode. Does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list?"
"Too complicated. It probably has a lot of, but it's not intuitive enough."
It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.
The motivational messages are annoying. You can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more. Good riddance. I suppo this kind of app is just not for me.
"edit : something more important, please don't make the user logged out after using vpn, it's a pain to log in every time this app is great, but please add the copy list feature on android too, and also ""uncheck all"" feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one"
"I like the app but there is one thing that annoys the hell out of me. I use a number of sublists for shopping. Whenever the screen changes orientation or Auto rotates the app defaults back to the first sub list and I have to reopen the one I was working with. Very annoying. Update; My opinion of the app is unchanged, but snarky respones from the developer are uncalled for. I get it, it's free, and I'm not using a lower end device. Maybe find a new hobby if you don't like comments."
"Very nice app for productivity. My favorite feature is that tasks and dailies that are finished can he hidden. However, it requires connection too much. Wouldn't mind syncing from time to time but I'd really hope there could be a way to tick off tasks even offline. Also would love to see ""weeklies"" or something that doesn't reset everyday for goals like ""go to gym 3x this week"" or ""walk dogs 5x this week"". Integration of calendar events would also be nice."
Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.
It's an okay app but I have found better ones such as I am sober. This needs to be paid for to be useful.
Generally very good. I have a few problems when I use it for reminders. working out what I need to write for a week of reminders in 10 days time is a bit challenging.
Please make the reminder work!!! It's really important for me to remember things because I forget and don't do it in the end.
"This app is great and it already helping me stay on track with some things. It's surprising how much imaginary experience points can motivate. But, I am having a bug where dailies can't be set for a given day, they just revert to all days being checked. I want this app to keep me accountable for working out on certain days, so this is a major flaw."
"I've been using it for a couple of years & it's worked well for me. I like being able to set reminders on tasks, something GTasks doesn't do by itself. I did spring for the paid version since i use it pretty heavily and to get the all-in-one widget. Worth it!"
"Fantastic app, simple and easy to use"
"I love it. I'm like playing a game w/o using my phone but if you think about it, I'm actually playing a game using my phone!"
"I didn't get it, but I don't know I'm the demographic it was made for."
"Been using it for a while. At first, i didnt like it as much, but then I played with the settings and was able to change what I didnt. I use it everyday to plan my day ahead. It's been way better than just having a running list in my notes. It saves your tasks so you can cross them out when you're finished but if its something you do regularly like laundry or something, you can just tap it to move it back to the top. Also allows subtasks. Def helps keep me organized. What I was looking for!"
has potential but the interface isnt user friendly at all
Turn life into a game! Create your own tasks and assign value to them! Pretty cool eh?
Great app. I would rate it a 5 but there's an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and it's annoying.
"A minimalistic task management and scheduling app with an beautiful interface and great widgets as well and packs a punch in terms of free features. Any.do does not allow sublists and allows only one level of subtasks to ensure simplicity, but compromising power. I have also found it quite cumbersome to add a task, put it into the right list and add a label to it. This is a long drawn out process which takes so much time and completely ruins the rest of the simplicity the app has."
The app crashes very often. You also have to restart the app every time for a reward to show up in your inventory.
The app is crashing always if I open the store of new trees in the latest update.
"I'm very sorry I bought the full version so quickly. The only benefit I found so far, is the ability to add more than 7 habits. I couldn't find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that I seem to regularly miss. I was drawn to the simple UI but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to Daily Tasks."
"I've used this calendar for years. It has always been the best. But now they've added ads. Unless those go away, I'll be finding a new calendar."
Nice configuration settings. Able to set most goals. One setting that I couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day. It seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work. The UI is slightly un-intuitive as well. I don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal. It makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app.
"No Resent Updates, no Local Backup Option. Other than that it's Good."
"This is app is perfect just need a checklist and daily, weekly and monthly tracker for each task... Had it been have all these, I would have given all 5 stars! You know sometimes we miss(or intentionally ignore) reminders and we need trackers for those for self development!"
I like the Apple task app way better.
"## You ""reaching out"" has not, in any way, addressed the question I asked, I'll uninstall. Thanks anyway. ## * Rather disingenuous response. When doing a local backup it informs the user that Manual backup ""will be removed in a future version"". Why would I continue using it if I will not be able to to do a local back up my data at some point ""in the future"" ? * I don't use the ""cloud"" so this will be useless to me if I can't backup locally."
"Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary. But the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1, 5 or 15 minute chunks is great, and the programmer feature works well as always, particularly good for planning out studies and work."
"Clunky, complicated, and confusing. Not streamlined. Ugly color choice for non pro. Just a disappointment."
"Needs more customization. Also, please somehow merge/connect to-do with sticky notes."
"Very nice UI, but need some work. 1) First week day (Monday/Sunday) option in Calendar; 2) Calendar should show tasks/habits below Calendar instead of when touching the selected day only (this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day/mont)... Add this and app will be more solid... And I may jump into Premium! Keep it up!"
"This is by far the most useful and customisable Gamify your life app. It also focuses on skills and character building, which is my favorite part and mostly missing with comparable apps. Takes a bit to get into it, but it's definitely worth it :D"
If hide the app its not working. Not sign out.
"For anyone with Adhd, this app is like hitting the jackpot! Simple (can't over complicate things) but very powerful. The 'Focus' function allows me to prevent distractions on my phone and see what I was working on if I am distracted hy something else, keeping me in task. It's ability to integrate/sync with almost anything allows me to add a task or event to whatever is immediately available before I forget. Only suggestion is ability to add contact to events/tasks."
timezone feature broken. the gamification was a little too complicated and too much for my needs.
"Very nice, very simple, very usefull, but the free mode is too annoyingly limited. looking forward to having the ability to link habits with my wife or friends."
Loved it..... It's the best app ever for scheduling and time management ♥️♥️♥️
It would be a 5* review if it weren't yearly payment. Put it a one time payment and I'll be the first one to buy it. This really ruined it for me.
"All free, unobtrusive advertisements, easy to use and tonnes of categories you can make yourself too."
"Great app, but needs to be able to switch accounts easily. I have an account for personal life, and work life. On my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist."
"Didn't realize this synced to my outlook calendar, started deleting work stuff and deleted two important appointments from my work calender. I'm screwed on those, was planning on using this for personal use only."
"It's terrific. So flexible. So organized. Wish it had a web app, but that is the only drawback."
"Increase my productivity, helps me to remind, and also the price for premium version is also very less."
"Serve it's purpose, but it can be run in background which should be neglect the whole Idea of note using Phone when focusing on other things"
Very good aap
"I'm using this app for quite some time, it has big problems which forcing me look for another app, it doesn't remind me on time, all the reminders work when I open this app at that time it was too late.. What the use having this app.. Please correct this problem or else I am happy the all the options and features.. Thank you"
Claims syncing but it always fails to sync. Lost all data when got new phone. Donwgrading to two stars.
I don't know how to use it .. Help me please 🙏🏻
Edit to reply: You never used to need all these dodgy permissions. What changed? Why do you need to read my notifications now? Update: used to love this app. Now it needs a bunch of sketchy new permissions to do the same job it used to do: keep you from using your phone. So so disappointing as now I have to let the app read all my notifications (????) or it becomes useless.
I love how simple this app is. I am able to track my habits and actually make meaningful changes in my life.
I can't sign in to my account
Quite good one but I prefer single purchase option. But seriously I like the statistics. Well I saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup.
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app
the app and widɡet are very ɡood. Will change to 5 start when I can be able to add task using google assistant.
Perfect for what I do
在我学习上虽然有很大的帮助，但是我使用专业版很常跳出来进不了应用(之前不用专业版还挺顺的)希望官方能够在这方面修复，那它对我来讲就是最喜欢用的计时app☺ *edited 我登入了我的账号后按进去app的时候一片白然后就跳出来了当我清空回初使用时或者删除重新下载就没有问题 手机型号 vivo v7+ VER4.18.0#438
"I've been using this app for at least 4 or 5 years now (when it was Wunderlist and now as Microsoft To Do). I use it constantly for weekly lists, groceries, and it has been wonderful for keeping track of odds and ends over time like books I want to read, music to listen to, etc. I like that you can attach documents. Only downside is I wish I could customize it more with different color schemes. Overall, very user-friendly."
Strong fallout/ skyrim feel. But full buy price is 45$? Even those games' price are lower on sale. And I bought them on sale. Other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars. And the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background?? I don't sub apps I buy them.Sub is for something like Netflix and Spotify...
Reminder popups are not displaying at the bottom of my screen on my new Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. They only appear in the notification area at the top of screen. Is this an Android 10 issue? How do I get the popups again? It worked fine on my Samsung Galaxy S8+
"It is a great app. But still there is space for some improvement. The calendar for example: you have one to add more tasks, other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job, but note one to see the sum of all tasks. You should create a resume calendar, where I can see the percentage of jobs that I accomplished in each day."
Notification features should be free.
"This is just a re-skinned Samsung calendar, don't waste your time"
Hyper masculine tone is very off-putting and irritating. Hint to developers: Women try to change habits too! At least give us the option of just having hints in our own words...
"Displaying the ""Contacts"" calendar of every Google account cannot be deactivated in Calendar & Tasks list (it re-activates immediately)."
Not Working On Xperia E1!
"In order to actually use the app as a planner, you have to pay money. Very misleading and dissapointing."
"I am using the paid version and this is really good, love it. Quick question...I want to integrate this with the Samsung smart watch. Is this possible, otherwise deserves 5 stars. Please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender Account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors."
"Poor settings options. I tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive. Kept getting emails for each task at the time I scheduled it. I also got notification pop-ups on my MacBook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my Google calendar. I went to Google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me. I had to delete all 10 emails, hide the notifications and now I will be uninstall this app. It should have an option to disable syncing. Nice idea. Lazy developers."
Very nice
"Used to be great app. Now sucks, unpredictable syncing and other day not syncing Google calendar on Android 10."
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.
"Worst app for reminder, period. Use google products instead. They will work no matter if you turn on or off the background use. This power hungry good for nothing apps are straight to be ruled out. Well if you don't believe me, give it a try and keep regretting"
ItS pretty good.
Подписка на полгода пропала сразу же после переустановки приложения.
Got a new tablet which sync my notes fine after I uninstalled and signed back in. My new phone won't sync. On the app for my phone there is no place to sign out! Frustrating
"I had thought this was wonderful. Not perfect, but definitely 4 1/2 stars. Recently, it's begun messing with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 System UI, that must be force closed in order to move on. I've turned notifications off, which defeats most of the purpose, but am still using the app. If I'm able to determine that it wasn't this app, I'll update my review."
"A decent app, but for me, it's not worth paying £15/yr for, and that's at 50% off. £30 is just ridiculous for a to-do/calender app. There are other task/calender apps, just as good and free."
"Overall its good but this new version is not working when i open store, app gets close automatically"
Great app 👍 could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list.
Still the best calendar app I've found. Nothing beats the month view and customizability. Can group calendars to display or hide as suits your needs.
"I love writing notes and to do lists. But this program does not save. I mean, when you write notes in the middle of writing and try forceful close (what happens, if phone crashes in the middle?) and doesn't automatically save. So I'm not really sure, if I want to use it, because I'm afraid I'm going to get lost a lot of my progress. I would like to use it. But for now I will rather have to wait or find another alternative."
"I used to love this app. It has great widgets and interface. However, about a month ago, it stopped syncing my work events and now they won't even appear. Turns out the account was removed. I re-entered the info and nothing came back."
"Assigning task is a problem and not available, the reminder is also wanting"
Reminders should be available for all.
"If only this app would allow integration with Google Calendar and Todoist. I really like the promodoro timer feature of this app and wanted to use it for my tasks in Todoist. Although this app allows subscription to local calendar, you cannot use promo timer with calendar tasks. Please allow integration with other apps."
I paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation. They fix that problem.
Thanks for the response to the developer you guys are great. I hope I can make better feedback in future
"It does everything that my old task app used to do (wunderlist) but has some additional functionality which annoys me. There's a ""My day"" page which, I like as a concept, but it doesn't link to the tasks I've planned for ""today"". If I want today's tasks to appear there, I have to open the task and add it to ""my day"" which seems like a waste of time. I'd ignore that functionality entirely but it's the very first item on the app menu and it just annoys me being there not reflecting my actual day."
It's kinda cool but the alarm icon disappear immediately the app is closed and therefore do not show notification when the time set is due.
"My personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app. The two things I want to do when building a new habit are 1) easily enter the stats for the habits I'm tracking and 2) see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard. This app focuses on ""today's tasks"", so getting to the specific habits, entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome."
i think I could really like this app. except I upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes. It will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search...
This app helps me many times and really it works as noone wanna cut its tree and we just do till time over ........ Totally it is nice ......god job
"I use the paid version, and the 24 dial is magnificent and very useful to visualize your whole day. But I need to view this on my Samsung watch. How to do so? provided that o see a Smart watch options in the settings."
I have a couple of requests if you don't mind. 1. Contexts/Tags; to further organise tasks into different categories. Kindly give us the option of creating our own contexts or tags as well. 2. The percentage completion tracker for nested tasks through a dashed line is pretty ingenious. Kindly add a numerical tracker at the end of the dashed line as well which shows the percentage completion numerically. Thank you! Shahnawaz
"This is my first time rating this app because I noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder. Hopefully after the task tab, the time & date will be under it. It's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses I didn't notice it for several times. Also,I don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people ;so it should not be the priority. I hope that you can do something about this. Anyway, thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks.I'll wait for another update"
"I enjoy the app very much and it's helping me kick some bad habits. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is that it often times does not auto refresh after clicking an item or useing food. Other than that, I like the app a lot."
It's a pretty good app and most important aspect it has is the ability to keep track of a habit. It's pretty simple how it is done. Also you can look back at the apps's calendar and see the days that you did follow that habit.
"I love this app. There could only be one checklist option, it would be perfect! ❤️"
There's this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons. Please fix it!
I have tried so many apps but i completely satisfied with only this app.because the font sizes are larger and visually feels good this is really very useful to make what i want so i want to get premium or platinum before that the developer need to solve the drawbacks that is transfering data one mobile to another and clear the different features about platinum
"The app is a great tool for tracking goals, which can keep you motivated to continue good habits, or stop bad habits."
"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? How do I open the app from the widget (so I don't need both the widget and an icon)? If I wanted to do complex editing, I could easily open the app, and the widget could do things the app couldn't. Give it back!"
soo bugy
nice but no daily notification come
"This app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do. The Quick post function is great. However, unlike other similar apps, this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen. So for me, that is really unfortunate. If this changes, I will gladly give this a perfect rating."
"Great app, very easy to use. Calendar view is amazing!"
"Nice idea with a few issues: some tasks never seem to go away. Whether I say I did them or fail or skip or try to edit they always stay there for the same day. Also, if I miss one day it takes forever going through each missed task and either skipping or failing or deleting or whatever. And like I said sometimes that doesn't work. Fix these issues and I could really get behind using this app."
Good
Changing from wunderlist I was concerned it wouldn't be as good. I'm increasingly appreciating this app. Seems big improvements were made to it to reflect some of wunderlist best features. Thanks for the work put in to achieve this.
not really the app that I was looking for but ok
I don't get this app
"This app has a lot of potential, but a few things could be added, and tweaked. I recommend adding a calender, and more icon options."
2020-07-03 update: ticktick seems to have added kanban view to mobile app and I am weirdly thrilled by this. This is the best cleanest Todo list app I've been able to find. Got my partner on and now we have a fully synchronized grocery shopping list. I live my life by my various lists on here and it's fantastic. Thanks team
"I love the idea of this app, is quite unique in the way it visually shows 
my upcoming events. Sadly, try as I might, I can't get it to refresh 
correctly with my calendar, its always wing despite following all the steps."
"I used to have this as my default watch face, but lately I can't put this on my Android Wear device. Maybe my Ticwatch is too old for the latest version, but it used to be the best. Does anyone know how to put this watchface on their Android Wear if it doesn't show up automatically?"
Free version too much limited.
I really liked the app but now I'm going to have to find something else. They have started to have pop up ads that are very disruptive. I was in a meeting and I had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and I couldn't close it until the ad was finished. It was very inappropriate. It is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads. I was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive.
I'm really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow. Downside is the glasses and headband can't come off the avatar. So my character is stuck with them for awhile.
"Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!"
Force feeds users with video ads after each entry.
"Excellent app, they greatly improved the quality since last time I used it. I'm a user of the web page for 5 year now, and the app was a little outdated but know it is very complete and useful. Thank you!"
This is only to add your todo list and thats all tou can do with the free if you want to put date and time to let you know you have to do somthing. You pay not good at all With free versions drom other apps do the same this pay app
Wunderlist was better. It at least let you move items in the order you prefer. You would think Changing the date would organize it in that manner but no. It stays in the order in which it was assigned which means you have to scroll a lot more than necessary
"wish the reminder have had a repeat function(e.g. every week), so I don't have to recheck the tasks"
"I have been waiting for a promised refund since 25th June, have sent several emails. Would appreciate my refund"
What happened to the repetition option? It disappeared with the last update! Edit: I uninstalled & reinstalled & that fixed it.
Good
"Updating to 4 stars because push notifications are now live.. Not Fully Developed. This app could be great, but in their rush to put it out, the features are highly lacking. No push notifications, you cannot upload stickers, no widget, pretty buggy. I really liked the idea of it, but it needs improvement. I will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added. They did reach out to me to resolve my issues, so I am updating to three stars."
"Great concept. But I didn't build up coins quickly enough, and didn't get any gems, meaning I couldn't get anything new for my character. Honestly, a calendar and check-mark system would give me more incentive than this."
"Helps me stop touching my phone It helps me stop touching my phone. However, there is not much thrill in planting the tree. You cannot select where the tree is going to grow, and eventhough there are number of other trees, it cost so much and earn so little from planting it makes it so boring. It can get quite dissapointing"
Why this  require this much personal details?
"It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them."
Hmm... I like it
It's such a bummer it doesn't work on the Samsung sport watch.
Simple and effective. Especially love using the widget.
"Meh, it integrates with everything else 365 and I'm kind of stuck in their web currently. It's a little too simplistic, I know a lot of people that have stuck with OneNote for their To Do items if staying within 365 realm. Google Tasks and Keep work much better. To Do does have a lot of potential but it's needs to be more robust without overcomplicating it. I'm still working on it but realizing that while their Automation seems cool, that it's just doing for me what Google has done for years."
Great app but it never archived old chores so didne let points
Simply fantastic and user friendly.
"Can't choose notification tone, has to share the sms tone which is confusing"
someone created a time productivity app that takes too much time out of your day to understand it.
"I've just installed this app and will definitely play with it in the next few weeks. It really looks nice and really structured! So far my only surprise is that there's no female icon for the person. Only nuns or dancers, but not a simple female icon that doesn't do anything - just stands. Hello, is this app exclusively for men or is the icon hidden somewhere?"
not really an exciting app
"This app could be five stars to me. what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do. There's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if I did not do them the day before or not click them, they just show up there. If I delete a task from the calendar on accident what do I do? the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless. I think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row."
"Super buggy on Android, have to close and open constantly for anything to work."
"Hi. Long time TickTick user. Unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed LOCAL calendars. Recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now. The last time it worked properly was in 5.2.1. I notified you guys a long time ago, but it hasn't been fixed. I finally tried Any.Do and it works properly with my LOCAL calendar so it seems that I will be giving them my subscription money this year."
Very good but should they really charge money for a to do list app?
"It's not clear how much it cost the premium account. Also, every time I try to go premium I get a message saying ""the in-app billing are not available on this device"". I've always do in-app purchasing and it was the first time that I got this issue. Really disappointed."
I can't use it because I must to pay and be premium that rude 😒.
"Simple design, clean UI, useful for use as GTD and also very powerful when using its filters. The best IMHO."
"Using the free version and it's easy, intuitive, and highly flexible...It reflects just what I want to track for five different tasks each week (from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where I log time spent on these actions and notes too!) I've already recommended it."
I really like this calendar. It syncs well with my Google accounts - better than other 3rd party calendar apps I've tried. (I've only used the free version)
"nice, but there seems to be no way to hide declined events? that makes it much less useful. Would give 5/5 otherwise"
"I wanted to try the app but it never opens. I can't even sign up or sign in, tapping anything doesn't work. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still the same. With this i stopped trying the app in a week, and opened it again today, updated the app, and still nothing can be clicked from the homepage. Idk if it's just my phone but my other apps are perfectly working and i never had this type of issue before"
The app was working fine until I removed Google Now. Now the widgets will not show on home page.
"Good idea for an app, but I uninstalled due to overcomplicated interface. For example, there are 2 ""+"" symbols, neither of which are self-explanatory (is it for a sub list of main list or another sub list category. I'd prefer there to be words there to explain what they mean and, additionally, a description of what list you're working under after you enter a list. I need an app that's unobtrusive but yet daily I can easily view my to do lists and subgoals."
"I would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my Huawei p20, unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything, I tried removing the widget and re-doing it, now it doesn't even show my lists, and I have to go into the app to check or add things, which of course means once I'm done with the current ones I'll delete it. A task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful..."
Can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee.
Been using this for over a year. Customizeable enough for the free version + no annoying bits. 10/10
I HATE HATE HATE how the My Day feature works. Totally different than Wunderlist and completely breaks my (and many others') workflow. Uninstalled.
Not user-friendly
Simple yet perfectly helping me achieve my goals
Easy to use and no more forget events with friends and customers anymore.
"Hi , i use this app to manage my studying And it works very nice But if it had a calendar it would be excellent If you can , please add a nice calendar to the app, that it shows our tasks too  Thanks for your amazing app"
For me is One of the best ways to do stuff and feel like it has some sort of meaning.
"I was recommended this app by a friend who loves it. I got the premium version as I expected it to have better features. This app is very confusing to use. I even went to the ""help"" section and was even more confused. I'm very disappointed"
"Horrible marketing adds every time, removing the app."

"I like the app, very helpful for lots of things, however I've lost my account twice. I've had to uninstall it and recreate my account. Very good otherwise tho"
Would not load
Basic features like comments and tags are behind a subscription wall
Very lovely app. Timer + statistics + it's beautiful. Don't care much about else. It just works
"I just love it, simple, cool and very efficient!"
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.
Love it except I can't change the positive memes at the bottom anymore.
Has potential but i need it for the programer which costs money
"Previously good, currently bad. This app takes you straight to Google calendarfor creating an event but once the event has been set, it's on calendar only. It doesn't even show that any event has been set on the app itself. I was using this app as sort of a time table but if I'm not able to see my plans for the day, then what's the use. Pls fix it"
I can't get new password. It sends message: email is not available.
"Really Impressed..! I was really looking for something like this. Thanks to the Team 👍 But, I wish the pro version price was a bit low then I would really buy the pro version too."
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.
Awesome app TBH.. seriously helped me a lot through my studies my daily routines to have time management in my life.. Kudos to Time tune app seriously very rarely you stumble upon a app Soo useful
"Love the way they keep updating new species of tree , keeps u motivated and kind of provides satisfaction at the end of the day ,"
"My rating is just based on my needs. The app says it has recurring tasks, it does not. It does have recurring reminders for ""on going"" tasks which may be useful in certain applications. The result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone. The exact opposite of what a checklist should do. If you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app."
The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.
"It has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals. But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful."
"A decent app for its intents and purposes but I struggle to stay invested. It's visually good, great icons and colours, also has a nice selection of skills. My biggest issue is the navigation. I can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks. Actually marking something as done, especially subtasks is a challenge - mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there. Perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier."
"wish It would link to my calendar so I can create, edit and complete in one location....that would make it 5 stars"
"A software expert. Just purchased this app. It's generally OK, but I am not very impressed. The most glaring issue is that you are confined to the app's predetermined reminder intervals. you have NO option to create your own time intervals (i.e. 12 hours before, 18 hours before, 4 days,5 days before, etc.). They say this app is customizable, as long as it's the developers choice of customizations. look elsewhere if you want total customization. I'll look for more deficiencies and report back."
"List sharing sharing is not working. UX is straight from iOS app, terrible"
"Some reminders get missed and I don't know why, mostly those that must repeat."
After last upgrade widget calendar date not automatically rolling over to next day. Also the widget will not reload when the phone is turned back on.
"The app is very good. It can handle all of my reminders and daily habits. There is a bug tho. When I try to complete my habits or swipe them away in the notification center, my entire phone freezes up for a few seconds. Other than that, its perfect."
after reinstall data not recover while take backup Google Drive
Great app👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
"The best app around for tracking habits. But the artificial limitation to 5 habits in the free version coupled with the eye-gouging price of the pro version lost it two stars. I paid, but I am NOT happy with the price."
How to use this app? 🤔 Very bad experience. Please simplify the process. Nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day.
"After last update the widget became very small, and clicking on it does not open up the full app. Also won't sync to my calendar anymore. Uninstalling."
"Good app, could be truly great if one more thing was baked in. Imagine if there was a difference between true due dates for tasks and planned dates for finishing them by. I'm envisioning features similar to Trello where you can drag and drop tasks with due dates onto a planning board calendar. This would be excellent for any college students with hectic assignment and exam schedules, or those simply trying to get ahead in their work."
I want a refund. This app worked great but now it doesn't work and tech support hasn't done anything about my issues.
Please make the reminder work!!! It's really important for me to remember things because I forget and don't do it in the end.
Not for me
"I loved this app, but until they get rid of the yearly charge after making us buy it to begin with I'll keep this at a 1. I did previously have this as 5 star, but I can't stand companies doing stuff like this."
Great so far! Does everything I want it to do.
So so helpful! Exactly the amount of customization I need.
The widget doesn't auto update after I add an event. Always need to click the manual refresh button. Same goes for when I delete an event.
Great App
two stars bc i have adhd AND i REALLY wanted it to work. it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out. I'll try again later.... maybe this fall?
"just downloaded. seems to be a simple task / to do list that I was looking for. QUESTION. how do I get the app to be an onscreen Widget, which is shown on the screen shots above?? Thank you"
this app is closing down everytime I try to do anything but daily tasks. rather frustrating...
"The app works great... with wifi. I love the feel of the app and desktop versions, but a decent chunk of my day is spent with limited/no wifi. I can't recommend it for that."
"No graph showing - shows the task sector on phone app, but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted."
"Linked it to my MS exchange, sadly It doesnt show the attachments in my calendar entries...shame as this was looking promising...😒😔"
"Simple , quick, reliable and very usefull app. I love it"
Works well but free version only gives you three total lists
This is the best app if you want to plan each and every hour of your day. This app will make sure that no time of yours is wasted at unproductive activities.
"Any.do is gradually becoming my daily tool for managing my schedule, tracking customer debt position. It is a rewarding experience for d money."
"Update - the app is from Hong Kong, and after the recent Chinese law I urge anyone to stop using it. 😞 I use to love the app rated it 5 stars previously, But sadly nothing can be done. 😟"
"I don't care for it, when I first opened it it showed me all these appointments. I was thinking what the heck then I figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current. To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it."
"Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander. In this day, building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iPhone. Now if I could get my work calendar on this app, wow, what a great way to visualize your day. Just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style."
"WHY? Why my habit streaks keep disappearing every single day!? :( Edit: Thank you, developers! I didn't notice that option I love this app❤️"
Worth it! Definitely helps make streamlining your day easier. You're either planning to win or planning to fail.
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon."
please add night mode! I study at night and the bright green screen hurts my eyes. Realluy consider this as an option tha many of us who use this app prefer a less bright screen that is better for the eyes.WE WANT NIGHT MODE!!
"Good application! One of the best habit tracker applications available on play store. Should have more features.. like authentication by fingerprint scanner, cloud storage, easily accessible sticky notes daily. The Notes option in daily habit calendar can be improved, perhaps adding a separate tab to view daily added notes would be a great idea ! I would have definitely bought premium, if it had cloud auto storage, better functionality for keeping Notes and fingerprint authentication."
Found easy to use but would be better if you could re arrange order of lists
limited number of habits only 5
Perfect. Only option I would like to have extra is the possibility to see the schedule clock on the screen of the phone before unlocking it in order to have it accessible with just one click
idk if its my phone (android) but i dont receive push notifications nor reminder for this app :/
Who's brilliant idea was to add several Holidays (which you can't even delete) that ARE NOT even US Federal Holidays to this Calendar?
"Updated: It's widget can switch between calander / todolist and view the events for the calander, in the widget when clicking instead of it opening the calander app like most apps. It's task list doesn't seem to sync to gtasks but the calander does. Upgrade to premium to add things like a recurring event, daily planner, WhatsApp reminders, extra colors etc."
Big fan of to do lists.
"App works pretty well, but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life, their Privacy Policy needs to get stronger and be better defined. ""We collect your data; here's a vague description of what. We keep it as long as we've decided we need to; and we won't tell you how long that is. We also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the Policy you may have originally agreed to, but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal. Don't like this? Delete the app"" .. basically the Privacy Policy. Not exactly trust encouraging. Fix this in a privacy friendly way and I'll change my review"
"I really like this app, doesn't give me any trouble. If something happens to my device I don't lose any information because it's link to my account, easy to use and. Although, I would like that in a future update to have the option to order my tasks by alarm/date time, no due day, that's already there, but the alarm and date that I set the task."
"Nice interface and it syncs across my devices. However the widget constantly crashes on both, P30 Pro, Oneplus 7T Pro."
I cancelled my subscription back in June of last year and just realized my membership had been reinstated without my permission. I would like a refund for the months between now and then and (another) confirmation that my subscription is cancelled.
"Seems like a very good idea but how can i edit what i've done the previous day? Eg. If its Tuesday, it seems to be impossible to edit achievements from Monday (which seems like a perfect thing do to on Tuesday morning ;) )"
"Awesome until.... I was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar. This app had some features that made it better than Google calendars. That is, until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment. Now when I save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad. I didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker."
The app lacks tools to view how good I am keeping up with my daily habit/recurring tasks.
"Though Im still new to this app, so far its been super helpful!"
"Quite slow, but overall is ok"
"Friend was permabanned for calling another friend a ""mad c**t*"" in party chat, but here in Australia that's a compliment... TL;DR over-sensitive language filter, should allow party chat to be unfiltered."
The app is just awesome now. Thank you seekrtech for fixing the bugs
"add check system, count system ( how many times) and timer ( count down and count up).. then no need to use other apps...Tnx"
"Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y"
"I've been using it for a while and really find it useful but it duplicates the tasks which is pretty annoying...i suddenly have to exercise 6 times a day XD...I guess that could be benefitial...but no, it's annoying really xD Will be glad to give it 5 stars once that stops happening"
The app does not sync with my Google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option. Meetings etc are not shown and I have to go back to the Google calendar or acalender to make sure I don't miss anything. Events made on my tablet do not show on my phone. Please fix this. It's such a great app if it just worked.
"Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names. App reset at around 7:00 pm, instead of at midnight of my time zone, which I had double checked beforehand. I want to like it, but this is becoming downright frustrating."
It worked for the first week. Now I can't add a task without it crashing.
The free version is good. Will upgrade to pro soon. Tick Tick is lacking video tutorials online. It looks much more capable than I'm able to figure out. Looking for a todo app that can share lists with others without needing to build a database.
bad. avoid
"Minimum 3 stars, no real problems so far. Nothing to compare it to but its bright and keeping me organized."
"Easy to use, simple functionality but well done"
Brilliant! the developers work hard to always improve an already brilliant resource. Well worth spending a little time and reading the get started and FAQ's.
Crashes on opening the store. Please fix it.
Great so far. I only wish I could set up one task for more than 1 day. It's kind of annoying when you have to do the same tasks daily to have to add them daily. If I could go into the date section and choose multiple days or months that would be amazing. Also making it so I can choose a time range would also be really helpful. Some of my tasks need to be 2 or 3 hrs long and right now I can only choose a time for a reminder. It'll help keep me more organized time wise if you added these. Thanks!
"As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E"
Don't use this unless you sync your tasks. The backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad.
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time)."
"I think its a great app, however, i came to this appexpecting a whitelist, wich i didnt get because i have to pay it. This made the app so much worse, if im using my tablet, i need to make work profile abailable to use in order to be in my classes. I can ask if you can add the option to watch an ad to select whitelist, that would definately be a 5☆!"
"idk wht hppen but every time i open the app it stated tht the app hs been 
blocked by system..idk y..btw im using oppo f1s"
I dont understand the idea of an account. Just give me an offline program
It's a great app.. but pricing could be a little lower.
"Okay if you like planning with Google. It's exactly like that, just prettier. I don't see how this can replace a paper planner at all."
"I love how many options you have for setting notifications. My Fasting routine notifies me at the start, 30 mins before it ends, and when it ends. Very cool. The app is missing two pretty big features though. 1. The ability to see how your routines overlap. Right now it's completely unintuitive. You basically have to do math in your head to understand your schedule 2. An indication for what the current time is. Again, math in your head. A schedule is supposed to help you visualize your time"
"This application is worth INSTALLING. It REALLY helps you to remain ORGANISED without any stress. Humble Suggestion: It would have been more convenient, if you had provided 2-3 reminders possible WITHOUT MANDATORY SNOOZE. To understand this concept very clearly, you are REQUESTED to study SnPlan application. All the best."
"Love the app, but I have a question. In the options under daily tasks, we can choose between Daily or weekly, What's the difference?"
It's Chinese so fear of data security issues. Uninstalled it
There seems to be a bug in notification & alarm.when I set a alarm or notification for a particular habit. The app seems to misbehave
"On the widget, you should have make it able to open the app when we click the task (make us easier to do the editing). And also when input new task, I prefer it was put on top instead of below so we can keep track to avoid double input. But so far still ok. Thanks."
I cannot login to the app
"It has everything I want. Grouping, but seeing them together, being flexible in ordering them, giving priorities, and the use of colours. The only improvement I would see is that those colours on the left are very small. I would love to see them better. Otherwise great app!"
"The sub tasks are really a great help in organizing thoughts and tasks. I also love the Projects section! It gives me the freedom to just dump all the stuff in my head, allowing me to have a space for other stuff to think about. My mindspace is feeling a lot freer than ever before, the simple reminder apps just don't work for me. I like the Karma feature too!"
"Great App I can't live without. Just wish they would apply the HTML Code in Tasks so that I can write in bold, italic, etc and I can drag appointments around in Agenda View of the calendar. Good work guys. Keep it up!"
"TickTick is very helpful. I like the various repetition options, especially being able to choose a set time span after completion rather than a rigid every month type schedule. The only downside we have found is that there is sometimes a syncing error between devices."
"Liking it a lot so far, but I don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks I put in. That's kind of the main thing I need it for - to remind me of tasks I had previously put in."
"Пожелание разработчикам: Невозможно перемещать списки подзадач вверх и вниз в версии для Windows. Удерживаю левой кнопкой мыши, тяну и ничего не происходит. Сделайте специальные точки за которые можно тянуть по вертикали. Посмотрите как в Google Keep это реализовано и сделайте также. В мобильной версии у вас тоже удобно, а на ПК просто бесит. Неужели никто не жаловался на это?!"
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.
Really nice but need some more changes
"If u make an app for samsung gear , I would love that."
"I like this app. If it can sync easily and automatically without delay, I will give it 5 stars"
so-so. not as intuitive right off but fine after a little of fiddling around. but the free version only tracks 5 habits and i dont love it enough to see the value in paying for it since there are other apps out there that satisfy the same thing.
"Confusing. Used to be better long time ago, not anymore. Confusing usability."
Why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without? Give me a break you filthy parasites.
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it."
"I really liked the app for its simplicity. That changed tremendously with the recent updates. For example, it now takes me 10 clicks to postpone a single task! People use To Do apps to improve their efficiency, but this app isn't efficient anymore at all. I hope the simplicity comes back with future updates..."
Love it!
This app is not working and gets stopped again &again
"Great interface and concept. What I appreciate most that other apps don't do is that they distinguish between habits, dailies, and to do's!! Props. Also I love the guilds concept as well. One suggestion is maybe have a clear visualization tool too see the progress made. But I get it the point of this app is to level up your avatar! Overall good job 👌"
"Don't like it much Event, Task, Favorites at the bottom confusion. Entering data is tedious too selected hide for completed task it may have deleted them. Need simple customization features and I HATE the computer time task settings which it uses. pros easy to read overview. Thx. mbf"
"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works."
"I am liking the app so far except for the fact that you can only add tasks to ""My Day"" for the present day. I LOVE the idea of a daily list, but it would be immensely better if you could plan for future days. It's super inconvenient to have to add all your tasks the morning of..."
Very helpful in organizing my life
Using this app lead to Microsoft locking my email account and support won't let me unlock it. Wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.
"It is a very good app, but it has many glitches. The widget requires you to open the app to update and in some occasions even when you check some activities as completed they still appear in your list. It is a good app, but it doesn't run smoothly."
"Loving your program, I've been using it for years. Thank you for your work! One function in Todoist is very missing - now when I complete a task on the tab ""today"" it disappears completely. However, it is much more convenient when it gets crossed out and goes to the end of the daily task list (like in Google Keep). When you see a task done today, you're very motivated to do more. This may be a paid function, but it's not in any form in the section ""today"" or ""coming"" now."
skips reminders until I pick up and check my phone. then they go off😖
Ok it was good app but all the good feature are in premium no use of downloading if I'm not satisfied why would i pay for a premium one
"On the surface, the app ticks all the features I require from a todo list, and there isn't a better one out there for me right now (yes, I come from Wunderlist). However, there are some problems that make MS To Do awkward to use. 1. You can share lists and assign tasks. This would work a million times better if I could select multiple tasks and assign them to someone, instead of tapping through 3 different views for each task, one by one, and if I could assign someone while I'm adding a new task. Web version is also missing ""assign to"" in the context menu. 2. When setting reminders, it's really not that convenient to click through a ""shortcut"" menu, when I can never use the times listed in the ""shortcuts"". Not everyone's day begins at 09:00 local time. Can you just let me always skip directly to the date & time picker on both due dates and reminders, so that I don't have to second guess every tap? 3. It's cool that we can have themed lists, but the feature is next to useless when I can't set a default theme for all lists at once. I have 20 lists, not counting the weird default ""Tasks"" list. I'm not gonna go through every single one of them every time I want to change my list background or something."
"Only just started using this app. Looks good but it would be great to have a calender view so that you can easily see what's coming up in the month. Edit: I will go as far as to say that I will end up deleting this app, even though I already paid for it, if there isn't a calender view added eventually."
Wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar. I wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible. Disappointing.
A good app but does not show full month tasks and that makes it hard to plan ahead or look back to previous events
The features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access. Will not buy something with so little real use testing.
This is by far the best To-Do app. I gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use Microsoft Account for sharing the lists.
Please build IFFTT integration so that any trigger can cause habit to be set as done/up-counted.
"I love this app so far, but I cannot access the store to buy more trees and plants? Which is a huge bummer, I love all the special little guys that need to be unlocked."
"Easy to use, compatible with Wear Os. Use it as daily apps for tracking my task & really love it."
"The aap good but not some updates are required, such as - In notes section add photo upload option, Add Journal Option,"
The tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand I have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
"It talks about Habit building, but in effect it doesn't help much, apart 
from giving very subtle reminders of tasks which, to me, were fairly easy 
to ignore. It doesn't really push oneself to break free of lethargy or 
other excuses which we usually end up giving for not keeping a habit, apart 
from few motivational text snippets. I would like to request you that as 
this app is named HabitBull, you need to Please make it act like a bull. It 
should lead (and at times force) the users to do the right thing. A little 
more aggressive approach to habit building is what could really help."
It was ok but only the first instance of the recurring events shows up on the list/calendar. It is important to see how recurring events impact the schedules in the future so users can avoid scheduling something on those dates/times.
"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me."
"I like the concept, and the free version is passable, but it seems like a lot of features are locked behind the pay version. I may end up purchasing, not sure yet."
"Love this app, bought the Premium (so worth it!) Helps me be productive and keep track on how I spend my time. It's more fun joining timed sessions with other Forest users"
"Sufro de ansiedad y TOC, han cambiado el diseño de la aplicación SIN PREVIO AVISO y no te están las cosas como yo deseo, cómo hago para regresar a ver los colores y los íconos, ESTO ES REALMENTE MOLESTO"
Works great!
"Great app, would be nice to be able to check the checklist items in todos."
"Has failed to sound and show tasks at the right time or at all, yet still put the recurrence on for the day after. I have a reminder set for every two weeks but it went off after only one week so I took my medication too early, fortunately no harm done to me. Uninstalled."
Habit widgets stopped working. After a day they just go blank and don't ever come back. The widgets where my favorite part of this app so that's too bad :(
There should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander
Easy to use. Has everything I want from a habit tracker. Great app. I use it every day.
"I love nearly everything about this app, but it eats up the battery on my phone like crazy because it is always running in the background."
"UI too complicated, not very user friendly."
This is one of the best todo app on play store. It lets you manage your tasks and habits with a beautiful user interface. I have tried other task planner apps as well but all of them are too cluttered and most of the features are paid for them. This app provides habit tracking and analysis of the completed tasks as well.
Too complex as a game! The time I spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working!
Amazing app keeps me in check and credible all the time
This app is great if you know how to use it... I downloaded it and it just doesn't work for me it says it's a routine app but it doesn't really let you put your whole routine it only let's you put one reminder at a time.
I don't know why... but it is showing forest is not responding properly . I really want to use this app again so I reinstalled it twice again but still it shows same problem pls do fix this issue
i need the application thanks developers :)
Why can't you add an attachment?
Awful the concept is great but it is not user friendly and super annoying I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it
Truly amazing app for me. This is exactly what I needed. The colors and themes make me finish my tasks actually. I'll ask you to have the option to set theme from our gallery. Thank you
THE best to-do list app out there!
It's ok. A bit messy.
"I really want to subscribe for premium, but the purchase options are not available, tried alternative option. It's showing unavailable."
"Love this app and use it daily! Great for task managing and motivation if you like games and collecting things! :) There are a couple of bugs though, and the app does not support some of the features available in the web version which i find a bit odd. The phone is the best place to keep a to-do list as it's always with you so i dont understand why the app isn't a priority. Im also missing an option to search or filter my inventory. Other than that i really like it."
I hated the pop up ads.
"It's completely broken, things don't show up, error codes from the very beginning, it's just broken"
Too invasive and complicated.
"The simplicity is nice, but sometimes I want something with more detail. I use it in conjunction with another app. If I don't have a lot of time to enter info, it's great for that. I like that you can change the background to dark which isn't so jarring if you are using just before bed and are trying to avoid being stimulated by technology. I do wish, though, that you could change the setup of a Habit entered between a simple click or entering more detail. Right now you have to create a new Habit if you want to change, but then that changes your stats."
Very easy to use. I have not experienced any problems with this app.
This app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen. That is EXTREMELY suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling.
Does not sync. Not worth it to miss meetings. Force synced does not typically refresh. Back to Google Calendar. Sync is a big part of being a calendar app.
Great app to set and keep goals. You get to set up 5 with free app which is plenty. Love it.
I recently signed up and paid to upgrade to Business Calendar 2 Pro but am not sure how to activate. Need advice.
"Annoying, obstructive ads. got fed up after one had a fake X button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it."
Good
Both useful and fun. I was surprised by how helpful it could be. You can also learn new things from the challenges and guilds.
"It does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person... Nice app, but useless."
Good app but faulty notifications. The notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if I open the app. By that point it's too late. I need the reminders to work to be effective. I purchased the full version.
"Update: still like the app, but now there are annoying timed ads stuck in after saving or editing, so I am taking off 1 star. Very customizable including the widget. I can make it whatever size i want and show me what is coming up at a glance."
"Easy to use, I just use the most basic functions, for almost a year I have had no glitches."
The notification sound isn't coming with this version whether I close or keep the app open. I checked all my phone notification settings and also the app settings. All are on sound yet there is no sound alert after completion of the tree plantation. This is very inconvenient. Please rectify.
great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks
Very helpful and users friendly app.

"This is my favorite to-do type of app, it's gorgeous on an oled display, but I really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists. To start a good habit I find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl, but even better is tracking how many times I actually did after a week and when. This app allows repeat events with notifications but doesn't track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on Cal or Google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore."
"I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further."
"Fair enough for ads but now the widget isn't showing anything anymore, it's just blank. I've set up all events and schedule and it's still blank."
"While it sure has its benefits, there's still a lot to be desired."
Everything I needed in one App.
"My phone freezes up everytime I complete or snooze tasks whether it be through the popups or just through the app itself. It gets pretty annoying. Please fix this, thats the only problem with this app."
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks"
"Very excellent, well organised!!! I suggest that more themes may come soon❤️"
"I've been actively using this and I love the concept. App version could really use a new UI. Dark mode would be appreciated, and maybe letting users adjust Font or size of boxes. (Feels too large right now. It would easily hold more details, but space is lost to a big box)"
its alright does same as google maps
It helps me think through all the elements needed to truly cross something off my list.
The functions of the app is great but the video ads causes me extremely high data usage and thus money. I am ok with ads but please provide options for non-video ads ASAP.
I really like this app☺️☺️
"Thought it be a great replacement for GTasks. Main issue with Tasks is lack of pc app. I like the any.do widget as it has a transparent option. I use recurring tasks a lot. A routine which can be ticked and on the next day they'll reappear, which I found seemeles in the Google app. Unfortunately in any.do you need to set a reminder for each task with exact time, they don't stack on each other, creating a long list of notifications in the morning. Also no visual event line in calendar month view."
"I really like this app. The concept of blocking your times is great and I find it helps me structure my time really well. It's also a load off of my mind knowing that I don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because I am at ease knowing it's all planned for and I will be informed accordingly. My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC. I think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing. I think it will be perfect to incorporate a way to set up your schedule on a nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications."
Important features locked behind a pay wall.
Too complicated
"it's a useful app, have maybe some things to improve like, the habit set up is not very clear or intuitive"
"This is what I wanted from long time, best app to sync with both my (Win 10) PC and smartphone. Customized lists (My Day, Planned, Imp. etc) + sorting orders both are best. Scheduling is awesome. Everything what I wanted. Notification for PC is good. (Please fix notification for android, it will be better if it notify like alarm - need user attention to snooze or off - and user can add their own notification tone also). Please don't remove any other thing. I loved the app for both PC+Android."
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.
Very useful app for routine planning. Loved it 👍
"Hi, please provide accepted, pending, decline tags on rutine notifications of activites and also show day progress for these tags or activites in app. I think it will ""force the mind"" to follow daily schedule."
This is helpful but is just a timer ...so it's not a big deal
"Seemed like a decent enough app, but I was looking for a calendar that worked with Google but that I could add local photos to events with, a feature currently lacking in Google calendar. Without that, didn't seem different enough to justify extra install."
It's a great app but I wish you guys would arrange tasks based on their set time instead of be prioritizing them.
"Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People"
"The alarms set, are not going off when they're supposed to...."
"The idea behind the app is nice, but it isn't userfriendly. Finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks."
I love love love the app and ever since I bought the Pro version I've had it running in the background and was still able to access other apps I use for studying. The problem is... I can't access the store where you can buy various different trees. So all I'm stuck with are the defaults and the Wisteria tree I redeemed. Five stars if you can fix this problem.
"The wiget is not synched up w the server. It worked until 2 days ago. I had to delete the widget, recreated a new one and all the events show up again."
"Extremely useful, easy to use and integrates well with everything else I use."
Night mode doesnt show up under theme
Only wish missed dailys wouldn't count for the current day too. Otherwise brilliant!
"I bought the pro version a few months ago and I have been very impressed by how well it worked and how useful it is in my everyday life. I am however suddenly having trouble recently with the widgets becoming unresponsive. If I remove the widget and add it again, it works for a while and the stops working again after a few hours. I am running nova launcher on a Xiaomi Redmi note 7. Please assist."
Very nice app but it doesn't have promodomo technology
"Amazing app, the premium is well worth it!!! Love the new UI and the fact that the developers are very active and keep adding new features! I'm glad to be supporting such a great and useful app! Definitely reccomend even if you're not getting premium, but there is no reason not to! . Edit: spelling"
loved it until the last update. now the widgets don't show. just a blank white block that says problem.loading widget. please fix.
Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed
This app is super helpful! 10/10
"Super buggy on Android, have to close and open constantly for anything to work."
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.
Spectacular in every regard! Everything is well thought out and implemented in a seamless way that integrates well with other apps and daily life.
Not bad but the best features of this app is contain credit
Had a good time in action movie with Buckley lanky man
Confusing and clunky.
"EDIT, Paid out GOOD money last year to buy Premium BUT you're STILL begging me to RATE YOU. Well my original 5 stars becomes today's 3 stars. Leave me alone, I rated 5 within minutes of buying !! ~ Old Review ~ I've purchased the PREMIUM version, thank you, the best in the play store. EDIT ~ I would appreciate it if next time you have a one day sale you make it abundantly clear in the actual app otherwise I'll never know. Thank you."
good app but had to uninstall. kept adding reminders to all off my tasks and scheduled events even when repeatedly de-selecting them. very frustrating and inconvenient to get the notification and the email notification.
"Very recommended! I'm a student and use TickTick all the time. Even without the premium features (which are very cheap and make the experience much better), this app WILL help you manage your tasks and your time. It's very intuitive and easy to use and you can sync it with your computer, which makes you even more productive. I've been actively using TickTick for quite some time now with the premium membership... Can't say a single negative thing about it"
good
App has stopped opening
Amazing up. I really love it! I have been using it for several months now. It has really helped me to develop very important habits
I love the idea of it but I am having a hard time trying to get started. As I am setting up my dailies anything that I set for weekly seemed like they are all linked together so if I change my days on one task it changes on something else. I like what it trying to do but if this isn't corrected then I will have to find another app.
good so far. only used a few times may review later on.
I absolutely love this app! It's very simple UI makes me want to open and plan my day every single day. Great job MS
Enjoyed it's use while it lasted. Uninstalled now.
Not so usefull
"App was great, but now I cant set my work end times, only starting due to it being restricted for premium only now after the new update. Bad timing guys. Uninstalling app."
"The free version comes with ads, and normally I would be okay with that except that it decides to interrupt you seemingly every minute to ""buy the full version now."" When planning your day, you might have to schedule time to exit out of the constant ad pop-ups."
"I loved this app at first, but now when I change my task dates/times, it doesn't actually change them, and continues to alert me at the original time even though I've clearly changed it. It's very annoying."
It's OK for now havent really done much with the app yet
Very confusing. When problems occur the resolution isnt made clear.
"Easy, simple, cheerful, effective"
"It's crashing everytime I try to tap on 'reminder'. Thank you it's really 
nice but the reminder part is the most important part for me."
"Good App. Lots of customization. But i have noticed an issue with repeating sub-tasks. If a subtask is set to repeat, it won't complete the main task. Seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat."
"I love this app, but have one major disappointment - when I input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day, it doesn't show a solid bar of colour from day 1-last day. Usually at least the first or last day (or both) show up as a separate event. It is very annoying and confusing."
I really like this application. Very well done!  My reason for 3 and  not 5stars is the lack of any security. No option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information.  PLEASE ADD SECURITY!
"I've been using this for about a year and a half and it has helped me hold my life together. It really does help you build habits, you just have to find out what works for you and sometimes switch things up a bit, because there are many ways of going about it. Challenges are very helpful, guilds are a great place to find like-minded people with similar goals and interests, quests done in parties are motivating, and drops like pets and gear are fun. And most importantly, it's doable!"
Absolutely worthless. This app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease-of-life automation. Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate. Don't sign up for the free trial. It's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time. Save your money!
I have got the Pro version
Wonderful app. Super productive. Work gets done easier. Faster
"Great idea, but.. I liked this concept and could see how it could definitely help, but some bugs to be worked out and in some place over complicated. Main issue for me was the reminders didn't work on android (galaxy s8) which made this unusable. Also struggled to understand the difference between ""habits"" and ""dailies""."
Weather not accurate. It would be nice task have options on bottom of calendar too.
It just keep on showing only one event whereas there are more than one events
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!
Need to make more convinient I just set 3 time alarm for the task but it didnt work
Bed application
"Even after entering an event into the app, it is not displaying on the 
clock face, and it says 'no events'. What's the point of the app when it 
doesn't do what it says it can?"
"Hello I really love this app. I wanted to add a small suggestion. Most of the classes and study tools I attend are pre recorded video classes which are not allowed on laptop etc for copyright and privacy purposes. These can only be accessed via phone. So if there is an option to add just one app that can be accessed during the planting, that'd be brilliant since we can study online while avoiding other distractions. Thank you"
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this
its serves a purpose
"I don't know what happening but the store doesn't work anymore and i keep getting this ""error code :664"" ... Edit 09-07-20 : i don't know what happened or what u did but it works just fine now, thank you ^^"
"Very good efforts Everyone who want to focus in their life, make their time more productive should definately download this app. It is very helpful. BUT the only bad thing about this app is that it requires money to create an account. See, users always seek to things or features that they can get for free. I think making the creation of an account free would help your app to spread amongst people."
Full screen ads...
All basic features are paid and the free features are very limited...Very disappointing..
"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!"""
Average app. No worth
Excellent app! I run my own business and this helps me keep all of my appointments and events organized so I don't forget anything.
I like the alerts .. it's a good free app.. I think it be nice if I could click the day then get an option for if I completed my task or not.
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Awesome! The layout of your time is done aesthetically and with elglagently presented information
"I thought it was a really good app until today. It started to crush and i couldn't do anything to backup. I lost all of my options, to-do lists,  achievements. Don't know what should i do, really disappointed. Auto back-up should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup files(not dropbox)"
its ok. I haven't been able to figure out how to get reminds
"Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts"
Pretty good.
Don't get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times!
"Good app, use it on laptop and mobile device. Suggest to add option to export all (incl completed) to Excel or csv."
"Great UI. The idea is great but need a way to mark tasks/routine item as complete. and so, we can't even know our progress. Guess the use case itself is completely different."
"When I goto monthly view press the date the event is on, the previous date shows up. Sometimes I am able to scroll forward to the date I am looking for,but mostly not. ( for example I scroll April 24th and April 23rd shows up). I like the design of the app,would like to see yearly view. I also can't see Events I posted unless I rotate the phone. But it works for tasks and notes tabs fine?"
"First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app."
Forced to review to avoid popups every few days. Ok so far
Very easy to navigate. I love it
Overall good. wish I could collapse into a more condensed view or smaller font (too much scrolling for longer lists). Would also like a notepad option.
"Good basic lists, i would like to create more lists, but the annual fee for unlimited lists is too out there"
"This is the best list app for single user and multiple users. Share with partner and family, save time and sanity. What To Do Today? With a little planning the To Do List will help you stay on track with your projects, remember what parts and pieces you need when you need them. Previously called The Wunderlist, Microsoft has actually improved it. Wow! Never thought I would say that."
"I used to really love this app, but lately it won't notify me when the timer is up. It's hard to keep track of how much you're working"
"The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone! Only thing I wish it had: a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits. For instance: most health lost due to *blank* etc."
Cannot create new tags. Even deleted a few to test if it was because I had reached an undeclared quota
"Nice,💥😊"
38/year y'all out your damn minds. Can't even view a full month calendar with the free version. Only day and week. Silly devs.
Nice pleasing UI to look at. App worked ok apart from a continuous problem with unpredictable sync problems. there is a lot of forum activity on this problem as problem has been around for a while. Eventually had to uninstall it because of this problem as it is a core function of the app.
bad
Better to have a search option for notes
Sync not working. Don't buy in-app purchase.
"I use the app as a kind of whiteboard to create a time plan. I am project oriented so when I have an important event to attend to, I might have to plan my day carefully. (If you're moving, you might not be aware of how much time it takes to do everything until you realize you're running out of time.) To use a personal example, I needed to go to court; I needed to be there at 8am, but I get off work at 11pm the night before. So, as soon as I get off work, I have 8 hours to sleep, but I would have one hour to do everything else. Would 6 hours of sleep free up enough time, or would I have to wake up earlier? I needed to figure out how much time to allocate to sleep, breakfast, getting dressed, going over my case one last time, commuting to a parking lot, walking from the lot to the courthouse, going through security, and waiting at the courtroom by 7:30am. The difference between this app and other planners/calendars is that it asks you how you want to allocate freed up time after you shorten a task. On other apps, you might have to manually adjust every task to close any gaps. Thanks to this app, I realized that I needed to prepare by 8pm the night before, so I was able to ask my boss for a half-day of work instead of working my full hours and rushing the next day."
I came here after watching himeesh madan video and like the review of this app but before installing it i checked from which country this app is o found it was Chinese so i became sad and started finding it's alternative and then i revisit the site and i searched almost for hour finding from where this app is and finally i found that it was from taiwan so i became so happy and installed it.
Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.
"I immediately encountered a problem when I began, by misclicking on one of my Habits. There's no way to correct for that. Manually change the values, yes, but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically. Secondly, the settings page is broken on my S9, and the issue is difficult to describe. The display freezes so if you scroll, an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below. Honestly the tutorial really needs work. I could go on but space constraints."
"Love the idea of the app but it's missing a key feature that I need in order to use it. Undated tasks should have the option of showing up every day (under tasks from the calendar/day view) until completed. If that isn't possible, at least a ""view all"" tasks function would be helpful."
"I really like the app but the downside is no offline mode, this will be a better app if it had an offline mode."
"Great app! You can put various tasks into categories, set a task to repeat, add notes etc. It's very helpful in terms of keeping organized. The only downside so far is that the alarm for a task doesn't always go off at the exact time. It sometimes goes off anything between 1-6 min after the set time."
"It's an interesting app ! Try this app To focus on your goals in more interesting and more fun way . By the way , trying this app for the first time !"
"It really feels like I have a tabletop character sheet for myself, and I didn't even know I wanted it until now. The skill and stat customization is incredibly deep. The reward system is great. I highly recommend the premium, if you can afford it. These devs deserve it, and the calendar is a nice bonus on top of all the aesthetic additions."
Excellent app! I run my own business and this helps me keep all of my appointments and events organized so I don't forget anything.
"App is good but I don't have audio using it, how can I fix this? Will rate 5 star if audio will be fixed."
"Very good and gets the job done, not the prettiest or well designed but certainly not the worst! It's exactly how it's pictured and works fabulously too. No crashing or issues here."
My calender does not sync with this app? How can I get it to work. It's great otherwise. How do I sync all my calenders with the he app?
awesome app
Good
"First two slides doesn't load, the character in character creation & menu items are invisible, pls fix."
"It does the job I wanted, that is to ring alarm at the set time. However I am unable to clear the timeline! That is old ones. Couldn't get much help from their help center"
Crazy fun totally functional to-do-list. Good reminders for anything you need to be reminded of. Sinks with your Google account.
Good idea but I cannot connect it with my smartwatch
It was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and I am unable switch the day..
"Hi Developer. Need to improve note module. It fix only for protrait view, which is when I'm using landscape view (tablet with keyboard), I need to adjust my head or the gadget. TQ"
"I don't know why should I have internet connection to add an attachment to my note. You can let us add it while offline, that's to be suitable for those who have no constant internet connection."
The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for
"Cannot get any of the other calendars to show up other than my Gmail calendar. They're listed in the settings, I've got them checked, but nothing shows up on the main screen."
No adding option for the time
Loved this app but I prefer writing things down
nice planner that replaced paper planner. i absolutely love it! no more spending money on Etsy for digital planners that do not give me notifications. this one does!
"brilliant! I absolutely adore this app. so easy to set up, makes using google calendar for agendas even easier than just using google calendars! the events on the clock face just clicked instantly for me, the fact that they can be colour coded is delightful. the widget is great, and even shortcuts from there can be personalised. I got the pro version even though the free one does everything you need it to. having 24 hour option is good though, and even more colour customisation now. LOVE it!!"
"Events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them, other times a certain day will not be selectable. choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesn't seem to work."
Love how functional and pretty this planner is! I paper plan but this is perfect for on-the-go.
helps to concentrate 🤪
"Opaque, complicated, janky. Overall, a frustrating and confusing ap."
"Repeat function does not work making the app useless as a task list. Might 
as well use my calendar. Almost missed a credit card payment because this 
app didn't repeat the task."
"Showed promise, but let down by an incredibly stupid copy function."
"I use this many times daily, and have for YEARS. Very intuitive and easy to change views. I like the slider bar and the ability to quickly show or hide favorite calendars. Moving appointments is a breeze. I have both Google calendars and an outlook one - this app handles both beautifully. Cannot say enough good about it!!!!"
"Not really what I was going for. It's ok I guess if you want to use Google or your phones calender, but I wanted a detailed schedual with alarms to remind me to go to the next event. Love the look, but not useful to me."
"Awesome app to keep your life on track. Would 5 star, but app crashes every time I try and add a custoum sound. Edit: Thank you! Will try again after the next update."
So far I really enjoy this app. I would love more trees and flowers that grow with the longer focus time like how the pine does.
"It does exactly what I need it to do. Calendar, to do lists, schedules. No problems, just easy."
"i bought the premium version, and now it can't even work properly for me. Everytime i try to open the app it fails to start and i have to clear all the app history for it to start. I don't understand why my app is in the chinese version and not connected to google play. Please help."
Would agree that it isnt very user friendly. Functions seem complicated and too basic at the same time
"I like the concept, but the execution needs work. In my experience, the app was laggy non-responsive at times which made the experience of creating and managing tasks tedious."
"Using the free version and it's easy, intuitive, and highly flexible...It reflects just what I want to track for five different tasks each week (from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where I log time spent on these actions and notes too!) I've already recommended it."
"This app is awesome, only thing I wanted was to be able to pause the timer but even with out that feature it is brilliant"
Great until it deletes all your lists. One day opened the app and noticed it said there was a sync error. Attempted to contact support and they just kept suggesting to clear my cache which wasn't fixing anything. If a to-do list app can't reliably keep a simple list not sure it's worth using...
"It is a great app, buy there are some problems, your widget mostly do not sync automatically with my phone's clock, so eventually I have to open the app and set the widget to match the clock. Please fix this, thank you very much."
Keeps me on track.
I just started using it. So I'm not sure how good it is yet. I do really wish you could do bullet points like: * - - That you could check off. It would be much easier in some cases than a separate sub list. & That is currently what I need 😪.
It was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
Its good App
"Great app for those who need extra motivation This is just my idea, but why don't add timed to-do (in image of monsters or something) that will reduce the health of the protagonist (or any negative effects) if they did not finish it on time It may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate, I think I got more ideas but will be too long to write here, so... Anyway, nice app, cool app"
"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking."""
Уууу
I love all of the features. Especially the lists and the stickers.
"When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C."
Unable to manage easily.. complicated
"I love the idea of this app, is quite unique in the way it visually shows 
my upcoming events. Sadly, try as I might, I can't get it to refresh 
correctly with my calendar, its always wing despite following all the steps."
Sufficient for my needs simple to use
Amazing app. I've used a paper calendar my whole life. This visualization and app sold me on going to an online calendar.
Could use more fonts and options and a habit tracker. But it's a great start.
NYC
"Hi, i change ""start day of week"" in the sitting but in the repeat option, when i check the ""skip weekend"", the program skip saturday and sunday!!! if first day of week is Saturday, then Thursday and Friday are weekend, please fix it for 5 stars! this is very important. thanks."
I'd love to see class selection. as an option when you start the game. I was forced to be warrior without an option to change. I even went to setting and nothing there to change it either...
"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume."
24 hour mode is a PRO feature?!
"It's a great app, used it for over a year happily. Even paid for it. Recently had to switch phones and when I reinstalled on my new phone the sync function doesn't work. Without sync i've lost all my data. Tried emailing the developers for support but they don't reply."
"It's testing the edge of my patience. Even though I have better internet connection it keeps saying ""couldn't find the Internet connection. Try again later"". It's my first time. I can't sign in so I can't go in to the app and plan anything. Already I tried reinstall twice."
"Beautiful App ... Always opens to bad news ... Overall percentage failure, rather than positive streaks of even one day ... Willing to upgrade with Habit App ..."
"It's a nice app. I like the reminders it sends every day. It really helps, especially at the very beginning when I used to forgot to practice."
"Had annoyances with the UI, the font was too big for me and I couldn't see a lot of things at once. And for all its gimmicks, it's really just a simple app."
"App UI is really good, i have tried almost all the top task list apps and like any.do best however would like to have Heisenberg matrix added to organise my tasks. That is the one thing stoping me. I want the quadrants features in this app and i would be absolute member of this app until forever."
"I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either."
"I am quite disappointed that the sorting no longer applies to completed tasks. After years of missing this feature in Wunderlist, it was a very positive surprise seeing that it had been implemented in To-Do. Now it's gone again. If this change is not reverted, I will be dropping the app. It's a nice app but it doesn't serve me without that feature."
"I actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders. I set reminds for monthly bills such as rent, and set it to repeat ""monthly"". But when I complete the task, it uncompletes itself the very next day WITHOUT setting the reminder to the next month. Basically if i set it to November 1st, it tries to remind me again, daily, on november 1st. It doesn't work. I love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly."
Why can't I change a single event in a reoccurring series? Am I missing something? It only has 'Change this and future events' or 'change all events in series'
Just 5 habits free !!!!!!
It's good but it's size is large
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.
This planner app is pretty clear and simple. I have the paid version and it works OK except today they had a glitch and I lost everything even when I reinstalled. It was just so screwed up!  So if you don't mind losing all of your work when they update... I guess it's survivable.
Works exactly how I would expect. I like that I can track multiple goals easily.
Phone: Samsung Galaxy J7 Star I just started using the app. I'll upgrade or downgrade accordingly.
I came across this as I was using Wunderlist before. It is an ok app. It has two downsides: 1. It does not update changes made on one device to all devices. 2. It does not link to Google calendar. With these two features it would become the perfect app such as Wunderlist was.
"Good apps, make my life is better. But, why I can't use ringtone as notification ? I can only use vibration for notification."
nicee
This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature. Resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient!
Can't order important tasks ☹️
"Absolutely love this app and have been using it for months. Different lists in different screens via the widget. Unfortunately the widgets have become unresponsive and now I'm looking for a new app. Will this be fixed ? Using Huawei p20 pro mate for reference Edit: I have reinstalled the app, taken the app off battery saver mode. When I reinstalled it is still the same, clicking on the widget does nothing, can't add tasks at all!"
"This app has great potential but is not there yet. Example, if a task repeats but without notification, then you manually mark it completed. The task is shown as completed & should advance to the next scheduled date. Instead it is showing up the next day as past due. But, if the task repeats with notification, then on the due date/time the system instantly advances the due date but does not show the task as completed so you have no record of the task due today & I have overlooked many. Not good!"
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.
"I used to love it, but now every time I want to add any tasks it asks for speak text, which when you're trying to discretely add a reminder is offputting. Fix that and you've got a great app"
Definitely improved my productivity... Lately though the sound keeps going off after a few mins and deep focus mode doesn't seem to be working.
"The app is great and has helped a lot even though I'm not using premium. But I think there should be a ""remind me of the habit next time I open the phone"" option, that would be very useful"
Very slow app it took me 10 min just to start the app....
Good app
Too many features locked behind premium.
"It's not working unfortunately. At first it was reflecting then when I added more items, it's no longer working. It just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created"
"I would rate it 4 or 5 star.. but it's just that the main features aren't free... Otherwise you can go for it.. It's an ""OKAY"" app."
Gud way to keep in track of our habits
Nice app for daily activities...
I have paid for the pro version inside this app itself. But checking the business calendar 2 Pro app I still am prompted to pay again. Why is this? Why can't I download the Pro version even though I already paid for it?
"Tasks that I change dates does not move to the new date assigned. I'm dismayed because I am a premium member. Moreover, it doesn't have a 1 week or 7 day folder. Apart from the calendar, I also want to see a 7 day list or folder..."
"I would like it better if you could add days of the week that would be 
super helpful. For example, I only workout Monday thru Friday so if I could 
have it remind me Monday thru Friday that would be super helpful"
Ok
"Very useful , cute app but sometimes not ringing or vibrant time out"
"With your friends you can play this game. You progress by completing tasks you set for yourself. Often i see t the app and think, well, 10 pushups isn't that hard, might as well do it. Without the app i wouldn't have thought that. Set small tangible goals. It motivates me to do the things i want to do but can't get in the habit of doing."
"Really head and shoulders above what I have tried before. Simple, intuitive and makes sense. Only occasional times not immediate sync from task you entered with date and your calendar widget and no manual refresh can be done. But this is minor and I still would give 5 stars."
"Waste , there was not an option to set an alarm to remind . I can write a note anywhere , I need the note to remind me which this app said it would . Too busy trying to get me to but it . I will just but an alarm clock"
Love this!
"Looks a lot like todoist. I said ""look"" because todoist is bug free when compared to this one. What a waste of time I had trying to set it up both by natural language and clicking..."
The best app for people with or without ADHD
Was working ok until today...Now keeps crashing the moment you try to open d app...
"need ui refresh though,  widgets need to show text on a month view,  theming... etc"
"Decent, used to be better! Now the tag stays on the text entry line so you have to manually erase the tag between each entry. Very annoying! I went back to notepad and pencil after this update"
Very handy if you're going shopping or need reminders on what you want to purchase. Easy to use and plenty of features.
So far so good for time management
"I miss Wunderlist. It was a near perfect app. To Do, on the other hand, is buggy as heck. The widget almost never works. Lists aren't always backed up properly. I wish Microsoft would have just left Wunderlist alone."
Love the way this app is helping me. Its Great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system. 4 stars only because of app's free theme.
"I forget to do a lot of things i think of during the day, Any.do. is an excellent way to remind me. Just set an alarm, and it will remind you. Even if its something days away.. .I highly recommend it to everyone.. even if your not forgetful.."
"I wanted to buy the app but the subscription feature turned me down. I wish there was a one time purchase option to unlock essential things like calendar, unlimited inventory etc.. (and the subscription for themes, sounds and other cosmetic stuffs)"
This is the only thing that has proved successful in getting me to workout everyday! Simple but v v effective and its always a treat being able to tick off my habit as done at the end of the day :)
It was to difficult and takes a lot of time to create a routine
"I actually tried a lot of apps, and after 1 year with Asana, I switched TickTick. Only 4 stars because the app neither fully supports syncing to Google Calendar, nor does it display the calendar events with the colors which were set in the calendar."
"Love the concept behind the app!! I feel silly but it still works. I am able to complete most of my tasks. My only suggestion would be: please, let the characters not be pixellated."
Wonderful!
"Hi! the range of the nuce coloured sectors does not cover the time interval of my events. It had been the best reason why I chose this app, to have an easy, straightforward overview of my plans. Why doesn't ut work as it is shown on the pictures?"
"Nothing work, I have my calendar prepared for months, and nothing come inside the Sectograph, Even I added new one, nothing appeared"
Nice
It could have been a robust app but these bunch of loosers want you to pay every month is annoying.
"Can't attach photos, says photo too large on Android, and on iPhone it just fails"
"Great app that really makes tracking what you should be doing good. It also makes premium a one time relatively low price and honestly, everything I thought I need to track habits and to do lists are in this app: measurable goaling, reminders, deadlines and personal statistics."
"I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew"
Lacks option to automatically skip all missed recurrences on recurring tasks. Manual skipping of missed recurrences is not a powerful enough solution
"We need an update!! I love this app and use it daily but the fact that we haven't had an update in months bothers me. Here are some suggestions I have: add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task (I use 45 min.), more color options for tasks, an option to change the notification sounds for each entry, a 'push all back an hour' option, and more widget options! Thank you I love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades!"
"Does this works on android 10? I tried installing it and tried to make a character but it seems it's bugging. Doesn't show my character (from character-making phase). Reinstalled it, same thing occurred. Hopefully you guys can help me here. Cheers!"
"I granted this app full access to my google calendar, but none of my events show up in the diagram. It remains completely empty except for national holidays (like National Tartan Day on April 6th. Yay!) I've given this two stars instead of one because this •could• be awesome. The design is great."
"Seems like I really great app, but I just installed it and I couldn't get passed the avatar creation screen :/"
I love the stats it keeps on my progress. It motivates me to get my numbers up a little more each day. Very happy with this app.
Wish I could add more habits
This app has changed my life. I have ADHD and this app allows me to have control over the the things I want to do in my life. Some small critiques would be to add sub lists within other lists i.e. a groceries list with seperate store lists with in. And the ability to move a task from one list to another would be helpful.
it doesn't work |:
"This app was quite useful to have and something I think that I needed. The only thing that put me off was the 'premium '. It slightly ruins it so I would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if I would change something about this app. Other than that, quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day!"
"Former version of the app: I tried several task manager services before settling on this one. Lots of good features without unnecessary frills. **** Update **** as of April, 2020... SO disappointed :( Unfortunately Todoist didn't know how to leave something alone that wasn't broken - and added unnecessary frills. The functionality has become too layered and cumbersome. What used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps. My time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks. After years of paying for the Premium and being one of their top users, I am in the market for a replacement. There has to be something that is more efficient out there."
I use this planner on a daily basis. It keeps me straight! Love it!!!
"Better than Microsoft To-Do, Google Tasks, Boosted, Wunderlist. But still not great because it does not have the simplicity and app task/event logic I am looking for."
Just as good as my old wunderlist app
Hate
Not working
"Amazing App, it changes my life completely, from now on I can utilize my time and measure that efficiency I do advise everyone to avail this one"
I do not use it so I want to cancel the subscription but am unable. Jorte had unsubscribe within opening page. Unable to sign in.
"Love the app so far. Great for motivation, but non-punishing, cute graphics, and lots of stuff to explore. Splitting up tasks by priority/type is awesome. It really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun! Would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting, gaming, or seeing your progress add up. *One note is that sometimes, lists of tasks disappear/show tasks already completed. Closing and reopening fixes it, but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed."
"Everything about the latest update is as bad as it gets. The bad home screen widget look with extra padding everywhere, no way to add new tasks to the bottom, gives me ride throughout 5-6 pages of the app everytime I delete something fro home screen widget. 😠😠 will be moving to something else."
"Really Good App for tracking! Easy to set, access and monitor. User friendly. With this app I can control my habits. THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
"This app is actually wonderful. I'm hoping you can add the ""forward"" and ""backward"" buttons on the widget (potentially just as another available function of those virtual buttons) like we have access to in the full app. It would be nice to click forward through the calendar and then, say, click the clock center to refresh and reload with the current time."
Good work
Premium is subscription based...thays a huge deal breaker for a TODO program....just saying.
"SLOW on laptop, does not sync with website. No stickers on app, just laptop. I set up my calander on my ohone, then went to desktop. I can't open up my calander unlesss I give payment info on laptop. I already set up payment in Google Play. And to get to that screen takes a LONG time."
"This is a fun and exceptional app for scheduling routine actions. You can also schedule non routine events too. If I had any quibbles, it's that it would be nice to make edits within the schedule for the day I'm on without having to adjust a whole saved routine day. Also, the emoji options could be more expansive (they're pretty good as it is, though). Otherwise, it's an excellent app!"
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.
"I was like great wit it until it erased all my schedules, then like magic gave em back 4 that month"
"Was really really excited for this, but then it's glitchy (I ended up with tons of duplicates of the habits which takes forever to delete cause you can only delete individually) and it relies on internet, so I can't use it for when I'm out. Oh well :(("
Great app that aids me in ensuring I stay on track with my goals!!
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.
"Overall, the app is pretty good. I have a few complaints, but they don't imapct the basic usefulness of the app. 1. The app doesn't make a noise when a reminder comes up. 2. It has been sporadic and may not keep a reminder posted even when it hasn't been marked complete. 3. The format for setting a reminder day is clunky. Recurring reminders are especially difficult and may not even be available (for example, there is no way to set a recurring reminder to every 6 months)."
"With so many free calendar apps out there, there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it. The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling."
You cannot change the default online calendar. This does me no good to only have multiple local calendars.
Really helpful app. But it would be great if you guys add lock feature for individual entry. And make the backup feature in such a way so that if i uninstall and then install it again i require a pin to unlock the locked entry. Also if possible add the pin on notification option.
Lower rating until I use it more -just started
Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though
It won't allow you to create an account with e-mail address and password. Why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it. If not resolved within a week uninstalling app.
"Crashes too often PS: Yes, my app is updated and yes, I am a pro user. This is an issue many of my friends have also faced. PS: 8/7/2020. Welp crashed AGAIN."
Not working now after updating
"Its a good way to manage your time, but after a while the timeline menu bugs out and stops sending notifications. Besides that the app is very good."
"Never fails...I suppose you expect that from an app but I've taken it for granted, and I shouldn't. It's reliable, easy to use, and I pull it out several times a day. It's never failed!"
"The app looked very promising, but there were too many ""Upgrade to premium"" notifications when initially clicking through the app. From what I saw, I probably would have paid for a year if I was able to try out the fill app first. Instead, I got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications. For these reasons, 3 stars and lost buisness."
I'm shocked there isn't a free trial period for this app. All the things that I'm looking for are premium features and aren't unlocked without a subscription. As a rule I do not subscribe to anything unless I am confident it will add value. A trial would help me make that assessment.
best habit tracker ✓ edit- can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph? It's not accurate- always trending down no matter what.
"Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly. Been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no. Incredibly obnoxious on my tablet. Haven't had the same issue on my Android phone"
This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature. Resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient!
My life is a game and I should quit to desktop lmao
I love this app but sadly it does not work with active 2 watch. Imagine the possibilities if you could have this widget on a wearable .
Nice app.
Great so far after a few days free trial.
"Please help me after update when i try to unlock plants then app automatically get closed. Saying ""forest stopped working"" of you fix these problem then i will change my review please fix this bugs"
"I have tried multiple kinds of planner apps and this is the best of them all. It is the only one I found that lets me make recurring to-dos, have everything in a calendar view and give each task a duration (paid features), track habits, have focus sessions, subtasks, reminders, get summaries about productivity, and sync with all my devices (MacBook, iPad, and android phone). The free version is good but I highly recommend the paid version. I am more motivated and productive because of this app."
I still can't sign up or log in. Store is empty and it crashes when I press the premium tags in store. Connection errors(Tells me im not connected to a network). Deep Focus still lets me browse other apps.
Very handy tool
Cant wait to try it
I paid for premium but I did not get any notification or upgradation. Still the app is showing the purchase premium option. Feeling disappointed.
Awesome app
Great app. The only issue is that the app doesn't open after the first day.
"It's done it's job very well for me so far. It prompts me to keep it up to date using notifications and accurately tracks my habits. Be aware that the actual improvement must take place within your mind, the app can't change you. It's job is to track your daily habits and present you with accurate visual data on your progress, it does that job very Well."
It dont have Alarm feature
"Got it primarily for reminders. It has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications, but those are pretty useless when they don't work. Didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff I set up."
Very easy to use Not complicated
"This new planner pro for which I paid for life is poorer than the previous version. I take ages to open, does not immediatly delete bring not all old tasks forward. Very bad."
I've recently started using ticktick. so far so good. It would be nice if you could alphabetize the items checked off so that they are easier to find when you want to add them back to your list. I haven't found a list system that does that yet.
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well."
Need options to duplicate List
"All right so to be clear, this app is amazing and I'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it! Even though it's such a great program, it became unusable at day one. It had bugs and limitations that hindered what I was attempting to accomplish. Problems such as: inaccurate characteristics, no quick access from rewards to inventory, non removable default achievements, inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics."
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} 🤔. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.
"This is a fantastic app to schedule my day. Thanks. Bought the pro version immediately. But if developed for Always on display, it will be very useful. Anyways, very productive time scheduling app."
This app deleted my whole google calender
SWEETY SWEETY Kumari
"I wish it was offline, like people may not have an internet connection always and it will be a little annoying to see that you can't move forward without internet. Also I can find an option to repeat my to do list . Like in Google task you can set a time for it to remind you what to do and also you can make it repeat. It's sad that a app like this doesn't have such a basic thing."
used to be the best calendar available until they decided to put extremely invasive ads. I know it requires a lot of work and I'm perfectly fine with ads. I'm not fine with invasive and deceptive ads trying to trick you instead.
I sent a cancelation request 3 day into the free trial and still you hit me with year. Very disappointed. I won't ever open this app again. besides it is not even a second rate app
"It's a brilliant, well thought-out, superbly designed, flawless app. Adore using it."
"The widgets keep disappearing from my home screen Response to dev: I use both the ""BC2 - Day Pro"" and the ""BC2 - Week"" widgets and they both will disappear randomly (and at the same time, not separately). I am using Nova Launcher; I have other widgets which do not ever disappear on their own. EDIT response to dev: I'm trying with the stock launcher now, but sometimes it will take a day, sometimes a couple weeks"
Having a list of things to buy with items linked to tasks would be great
Doesn't give any notification and nothing I missed a registration!!
Revised rating. Have been using this for a number of years now and I think it's brilliant.
"List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!"
"Not sure yet,still testing it"
"The app is pretty good and has good features. However, when I shared a grocery list with my fiance it wouldn't let him accept and it it sent him TONS of emails regarding it. Literally 1 every few minutes for hours and I have no clue how to stop this without him just unsubscribing. Given that sharing is a big part of why I wanted the app, it does put a damper on things for me."
it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.
"Seems like it could have been great for me. However, lack of ability to modify repeating schedule (e.g. which days of the week) is a blocker. Switched to HabitHub for now."
You should have the choice to swipe left and right for different months and just up and down Also change the word title event colors on a particular day to make it stand out.
"Needs to give you the option of adding pictures when note taking. If it had this option would be excellent, otherwise not a bad app."
"been using for couple of years with no issues, till the recent update with ad pushing.. well, can't really complain coz we're using it for free.. but it's too distracting when you're checking your appt during crunchtime. unstalling as a result. reverting back to plain old no fuss google calendar. tks though"
It wouldn't let me try the app. It just told me to subscribe.

Something that bothered with the calendar widget is that tasks that span for multiple days are separated into blocks in contrast to a continuous line.
Wow this is what i was exactly looking for. Bought premium on the first day. Add many more features in the coming updates
"Not bad, pretty basic but its helpful"
otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours... very disappointed ... you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated...
Great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star... please fix this...
Helps a lot in reminding of tasks to be done on daily basis.
COOL UPDATE GUYS!
"Well, its a nice app. Simple, possibly simplest it could get. I enjoy using it and also helped me a lot. But the app could do more with reminders and also the look of it. Reminders could be with alarms and also the looks can be a little more detailed. Would be a lot better if we had better home screen with icons and graphics instead of lists etc. I would have given 5 stars if it had more looks and graphics to ease out the stress instead of lists of letters and tasks ......"
"I have never seen a more beautifully designed calendar+planner app. Easy on eyes, strikes a great balance between functionality and simplicity (Google and Microsoft calendar apps should take inspiration from this) and ... just great. When I start earning I'm definitely going to buy this app just to show gratitude :)"
"Its ok, bought it, sadly need another payment to customise palette, sad, hope more update come"
"Its super flexible, i love it!"
App is good but no task sync between devices is a big let down
Best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire. They only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if I open any other app. Old standard Android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until I dealt with it - far superior. Please bring that back.
"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it."
"On my S9+, it's started giving notifications some minutes after the event. It actually states it, e.g., ""4 minutes ago."" The time delay varies. I hear the notifications announce on time on my Huawei tablet."
does not update tasks in widget automatically
Great app and easy to use. Would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect. That aren't just for the day.
"Not much to say here. It's good. Pros • Syncs with your PC via the cloud. A must have nowadays. • Interfaces with OneNote via links in the ""Add File"" section. I use both - that's good. • Displays schedule on mobile home screen. I find Task display best for mobile and Planner display best for PC. • Subtopics are nice if you have a list of things that need too get done under a main topic. • Alarm set separately from due date • Color change or separate listing for overdue items. [I love deadlines. I love the whooshing sound they make as they go by.] Cons • No snooze on mobile. Mobile - alarm rings once (softly) and does not repeat for that notification. It would be nice if you could set it to go off every 10 minutes or so until you tell it to shut up. It does leave notifications in the notification bar. • I don’t see any way to set alarm sound or duration or volume on mobile."
"Looked good, but wasn't. After installing Tasks, my keyboard stopped appearing for all my apps. It was only when I removed Tasks (as a last resort) that the keyboard appeared again."
"If you want to use dark mode, you'll have to but ""premium"". I understand the need to make money off your app, but thats just scummy."
"Mostly works, but it's irritating when you have to log out and back in to force the lists to sync fully. Sometimes it doesn't even work so you have to do it multiple times. And there are times repeating tasks will randomly stop repeating. It's especially upsetting when you've removed over 100 tasks from one list and it isn't reflected on your other linked device, or if you share with another person and eat they see isn't synced."
Can't use it without email.
"I installed every todo list app and I was unsatisfied. Most of them were not offering widget facility. But this app is all-in-one. You can collaborate with other apps as well, make to do lists, set alarms, make folders, set priorities, label your tasks and many more. This app is keeping me busy. Now, I love to do my tasks to update my list everyday."
"I wish I could delete things that automatically show up in my calendar, things like holidays in other countries etc., I don't want ""everything"" showing up that really doesn't pertain to me. If there is a way, I haven't found it!"
"I'm editing my review due to the new update. Dear todoist, the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app. I have to click on the three dots then on move project. This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design. I would tweak one little thing or too, but overall todoist is almost a perfect product."
this app is missing subtasks and obviously no prioritizing subtasks. when subtasks are added if they ever are please make with all the primary task options and a next action option.
It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thanks so much
Missing back buttons on some screens. Otherwise great.
"I really liked the app, helped me a lot with managing my time efficiently 
to get the most out of my day, but since I updated it it started acting up, 
it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now it's 
setting it's own times or plainly refusing to be moved to a later time 
block, which is infuriating. And the app also slowed down considerably 
after the update."
Widget is not working properly with nova launcher.. Every time you have to open the app to add new task after clossing the app by recent apps.
"This handled tasks exactly as expected. Due dates sort into categories, with overdue tasks exposed as well (a simple thing that Microsoft To Do continues to botch). The best replacement for Wunderlist, even if you have to pay for access to simple things like comments and reminders (worth $5/yr at most, but I'll pay the extra to avoid the UX issues in other apps... for now)"
Why would I pay for this app for reminders? It's just a goddamn simple feature!
"Generally good but has issues, adding a subtask is just weird - why they can't do what wunderlist does with a place to add or a button, and it's all a bit sluggish with some redraw problems. But it has some great ideas to it, so maybe it'll be good in time."
It takes forever to download
Not able to open events into another calender app. It always opens events in my native mobile calender app
Excellent app... Good job!
Doesn't sync with Microsoft Outlook To-Dos categories. Useless to me without this. I'll wait until they add this feature to use. I will keep using Tasks and Notes app until then. That app works great!
"Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me."
Great app! No ads and does just what it says on the tin!!!
Probably the best task managing app out there.
it just crashes every time i want to set timer for no reason!!!
Very helpful with lots of features. I would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though. Also it would be delightful if we could add tasks (like the notification) with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up! But still nothing I would pay annually though..
"Could be streamlined better, like being able to see your forest from the beginning"
Love the look of this agenda. List feature is great way to track & complete to do lists!
Not good
Bought the premium version long ago but now it has ad on it.
"Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it."
"Does not sync across my devices, which it claimed it does. Only reason I purchased. Looking for my refund."
You cant set reminders without paying. What is the point of an electronic to do list if you cant be reminded to do your tasts.
Love it! Gave it a 2nd try and it really helped me stay on track with my routine. Such intuitive tools and functions. The only problem is that it keeps malfunctioning and doesn't update notifs or even the widget
"I love habit bull. I did not expect to feel connected to people when I purchased this app but that is what happened. Realising that other people have challenges with habits made me feel, alive, like I was not alone. I only wish the reminders would play on continuously like an alarm, because sometimes I forget to check things off."
I can't delete tasks from the old challenge anymore
It doesn't remind you for weekly or daily tasks if you don't tap on 'done' circle. Please fix it to remind us although we don't tap on first day's tap to make it done
"Make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications.The app works great, and is super helpful. The only thing I would recommend is to be able to make custom categories. Right now you can do other, but can't specify. Would definitely recommend app. Update 2- I can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications. I can get it to work but only once then it stops. Would you be able to help me out? After my first review you said you'd be able to if I needed it."
The time displayed does not automatically update. One has to cluck on the widget and enter the app for it to sync with actual time.
I like this app but this is the buggiest app i ever had i been using this for years and still havent fix them
"Looks good, but is for me worthless without notifications. And then 3-4 $ per month in order to activate notifications is way too much. Maybe 1 $ could have been worth in order to move away from Microsoft's free TODO app."
love it never forget to buy if it on the list
Forest stay
Very good reminder
I am running this app on a Droid Turbo with stock  Lollipop installed.  The app has a very nice layout but unfortunately I find it to be very buggy.  It is impossible to create an event that includes Monday and the app can't import recurring events from Google calendar.  I have reported these to the developers and hope the app is cleaned up soon.
"Great addition to having a calendar. I can set text reminders for To Dos from here so I don't have to clutter my family's digital calendar with details for my days. Took a while to get how the app and folders work, but I have a good system set up now."
"I prefer the browser version over the app version. It's hard to find all the options in the app version. The app and browser also don't sync well, and one time I lost all of my health and money upon opening my app version for the first time in a long while even though I had used the browser version earlier."
Love habit forming features! Wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists.
"I love this app, but I do have one major gripe - I want an option to buy premium once (even at a higher price) and not as a monthly or yearly subscription. Edit - very unhappy with developer response to pricing. I want to buy premium for this great product they made, but it's NOT a service. This isn't Netflix. You're going to turn potential buyers away with this pricing model"
"Cute, but seems like it would benefit from a way to set eg monthly or annual reminders for bills and birthdays without going to a Google script."
"Please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit, I feel like I'm cheating when I delete and re-add a whole habit because it's bugging me. Otherwise the app is a gem. 3 stars till you fix this for me. It still doesn't work, I don't want to delete a task, I want to unclick a habit, because I've accidentally clicked positive/negative and I can't undo it. Even if I click the other one to make it even, it just registers it as a separate log."
"It's a good app, no question about it but it's not perfect. I used it for months after abandoning todoist but I'm leaving Ticktick now. It's feature packed but not as polished as other products. The UI is not great and the app has very different design language as well as features depending on which device you open it on. This lack of consistency as well as poor natural language support doesn't make it the perfect ToDo app."
So so. I expected the ability to attach files to notes and a lot more flexibility with format.
"Really unimpressed that I cannot get notifications unless I subscribe to premium. I can set up memos on my Google calendar & be reminded for free. Why would I pay for that with an app? Without notifications I'll have to remember to check what needs done, where I'm at, etc. I also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate & use what little was included in the free version. Gave up in frustration when I realized that to be actually useful I'd have to pay extra."
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.
Twice lost all data b/c wouldn't sync. Had over a year of data. Had premium and still didn't make a difference. Moving on. Just done. So upset!
"Great app! I use TimeTune to time block my entire day into short segments. A few fixes: [ when scheduling a day in advance, the time auto-sets to 24 hours (ending next day). If I scheduled breakfast from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM, it automatically sets to 830 AM the next day. Very tedious to change.] [difficult to see overlapping tasks] [no easy way to push an entire schedule back, if you are late on one item, and need to push everything by 10 min for example. You have to change each manually.]"
This is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff. I would suggest add some tutorial on YouTube so anyone can get used to it. and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version.
"They should make a website, that is in sync with your phone"
Free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing
"Use Google Tasks! It's much better and FREE 🥳 You have to subscribe £1.50 a momth to get full use of this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 It's a basic reminder app. Had it have been a one of payment of a tenner then I'd have brought it but I hate it when you have to subscribe, especially for something so basic as this. They do it so you subscribe and forget about it. Just greed."
"System works okay, but there are several screwy. Does not appear to be any kind of search feature to find items for also it would be better if more information was provided on how to operate the system."
"I can't be the only one multitasking. Therefore, I don't have time to figure out a basic program. I put in a picture and it was so tiny! I put in my tasks yet some are ""timeless"", some are daily, and there was powerlifting! I'm physically crippled!"
"It's pretty good just few features to be added for it to be even more better eg. Sharing tasks, adding sounds to the notifications popping up. Otherwise I love it"
"Update: developer responded quickly with explanation. So impressed that I'm trying it anyway. ___ Original review: Couldn't move onto SD card, so didn't have the space to keep it and try it properly."
"I'm having the same issue as Jackie Hutton 28/04/20. Repeating daily reminders are no longer working and are being missed due to marking as done from the notification. This wasn't an issue before, and once rectified, the app would definitely be worthy of five stars again. *Edited to add: If it was an issue with my device, surely the problem would have been there from when I first downloaded the app? It's an issue that wasn't there previously and has only been there for the last week or so."
"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works."
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!
"Really helps to know when tasks are completed. It would be a solid 5 if, when you shared say with google drive, that the Completed DATES would transcribe in the transfer. Major reason for chosing this app was knowing when something was accomplished. Otherwise a great piece of software. Very functional in task management."
"**UPDATE**. I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon."
Used to work great. Unfortunetly notifications no longer go off for ir making it useless. Have checked they are not blocked
"The calendar should be able to set up recurring events easier. Updated: The calendar still makes it difficult to define a recurring date that occurs on the 3rd Monday, 1st Thursday, etc. It should be more intuitive. Also, it should allow you to define the event type better instead of just birthdays, anniversaries, etc. A custom event type that is user defined would be nice, like job anniversary, named day, National BBQ Day, etc. How do you import a list of holidays from a file (HTML,TXT,XML) ?"
"This seems to tick (ha!) most of the boxes, multiple to do lists, habit tracking, Pomodoro timer. The only place I wish it were better is in statistics and graphs of habit and to do completion"
"I'm just starting out with Habitica and am liking it so far, but the To-Dos would be much more useful if they could be organized by due date. I've got like 25 things on that list, with due dates over the next two weeks or so, and it would be much easier to actually accomplish these things if I could easily see which were the most urgent instead of having to scroll up and down and compare dates in a mental tally."
Very easy to use. Nice features.
good app. The way subtasks are structured are a pain in the ass though :/
"I used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive, taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything. I guess I'll go back the regular Google calendar app. Reply to developer: that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads. For now I'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps."
"Be careful users !!!!! I really love this app, but the deep focus mode seems too evasive & has the potential to collect your data. The deep focus mode feature does not let you choose which permission/controls to turn off. For ex, it requires you to turn on 'enable notification access permission' which lets the app read & collect all the notifications you receive plus personal contacts and messages. Please have an option to have the deep mode feature on w/o all of the permissions being required."
"""Custom Swipe Options"" hidden in premium 😂"
"I really like the app, love my forest and stay at a higher level of concentration. But I apparently reached the limit of real-trees, which is only 5 and way too low! Otherwise a 5 Star experience!"
Simple to use. It seems they will load up features that make it less simple. Maybe they need a simple and enhances mode to choose?
You cannot change the default online calendar. This does me no good to only have multiple local calendars.
"Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary. But the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1, 5 or 15 minute chunks is great, and the programmer feature works well as always, particularly good for planning out studies and work."
Why can't I change a single event in a reoccurring series? Am I missing something? It only has 'Change this and future events' or 'change all events in series'
Good app. However the notification has stopped working.
"It's the worst app ever, doesn't give any reminder doesn't work ..... Just a waste of time!!!!! 👎👎👎👎"
"One of the billions of to-do lists app. Nothing special. Unpredictable non-intuitive behavior, as usual. Useless hints for features, that are obvious. I've thrown this app away after the third time, when I accidentally removed my task while simply scrolling the list."
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc"
"Good tool to manage one or more calendars in one view. Connects to gmail, contacts, phone, google drive and more"
Please fix the widget. It keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time
i liked it because of plan a tree cz i really needed it but it's expensive soo.. k bye
"Seems like a good idea, but doesn't actually do anything but waste more time. Completely useless. Can't find calendar events. Each event has to be re-entered manually. Why would anyone want an app that is just MORE WORK? STUPID! HUGE waste of time!"
"I really like the app, but I would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in LifeRPG. Also, if there was a quicker way to edit like in Life RPG that would be great. I would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys, but right now LifeRPG is more practical and they'll get my money until you catch up. Love the decreasing skills btw :)"
"Really good for managing all my tasks for the day. I particularly love the widget, that always reminds me of my tasks."
Im still getting accustomed i like the simplicity
its good nd loved it but need to more developed
"Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just ""business calendar"". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock ""the free version has ads"" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star."
"It works perfectly for me and I am loving it. I would appreciate it more if you guys could add weather support on the widget. By that it can replace my Home Weather/Time widget and I could ise only this widget for my Time, Tasks and weather."
"I have used this for a while and, though it isn't a perfect fit, it does a great job of allowing me to schedule alarms for tasks and easy snoozing of those alarms. But they updated and fixed what wasn't broken. Now, all uncompleted tasks show in the task window with no delineation of whether they are recent, scheduled, or past due. Visually, it is very confusing. I'm probably going to dump this app. I would like a good calendar view of things scheduled on each day and it doesn't have that."
Beautiful and detailed app! There are two features that would make it more useful: 1) a counter to keep track of quantity (example: alcohol drinks); 2) a limit which causes a fail if you go over (example: limit 14 drinks in a week or 2 per day)
"It has a lot of functionality bugs. Some of my events were not adding, after restaring the app, other events just disappeared etc. I m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working. Thanks!"
"Not very easy to use. You can figure it out after you play with it long enough, but over all, not very intuitive."
Your App schedule doesn't update in real time. Troubleshooting makes it work and then again same issue.
This app used to be brilliant. It then began to function regardless of whether you were using your phone or not- essentially just becoming a basic timer. And then now the timer fails and kills trees when youre not using your phone. I just planted a tree only for it to die 20 seconds after when my phone locked.
Widget stopped showing the correct day which makes it pretty much useless which sucks because it was the easiest way to use the app for me..PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Amazing App, it changes my life completely, from now on I can utilize my time and measure that efficiency I do advise everyone to avail this one"
Awesome app but it kept losing sync with my work calendar which uses Office 365. Hope it gets fixed one day.
Works perfectly. Helping heaps to manage my day.
"Did not enjoy the layout, workflows, rewards, explanations. A+ for the effort."
"Suddenly, again (it has happened before), the widget is empty. I keep refreshing, but the entries vanish."
I cant Register on this app. It always says 'server connection lost '.
"Def prefer this to Google calendar, wish it was easier to see and switch to month view."
Best to do list app available
I couldnt even get past setting everything up before it glitched. I couldnt move on from types of goals. A pop up showed up that said something about strength and attributes.
"Great potential, but I can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter-intuitive layout. Just filling two days in Routine view turned it into an endless scroll. Shame, the app really looked like what I was looking for. Reply: Thanks for taking my review into account. Yes, I think a horisontal orientation would be much better. Maybe leave both options? That way everyone can decide what best suits them."
Bestest app ever I love this app it helped me a lot to remember things I have to do
Great help every day
"Bought the paid version and this was working exceptionally well until recently. My Gmail entries now only appear for the last two years, or so, and not beyond. The Google calendar shows them all, so not sure why it's not synching fully."
I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes
Not easy to use also not effective
"beginning setup wasn't loading at all. signed up using Facebook. since it was not loading, i just clicked next. now I'm stuck with my Avatar with no way to change"
"Why can't I open the app? I used it once and I liked it but the second time when I tried to open it, I couldn't."
"This is an expensive app. That being said, it's the most low-rent experience you can imagine. For example, when you create a list item and need to edit it, you're completely out of luck because that can't happen. The best you can do is delete it and type it in (again) correctly since edit is not an option. By the way, deleting an item from your list is a multi multi step process. (update: developer noted that editing was possible (though, multiple steps required), item deletes still impossible)"
"I sadly had to uninstall this app as tgere was no general opt-out option for direct marketing activity. I could opt out of seeing personalised ads on this app i couldnt opt of my data being collected and combined with other sources and shared by all of their many advertising partners, which for an app like this is just too invasive. Very saddened, as the app does look really good."
Does not sync well between devices. Repeatedly forces log in and wipes tasks
practical and easy to use
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying
good app that does it's supposed to. wish it had some improvements to make it great (suggestions in the in-app forum)
"New update made me little bitter(in routine section ) ,kindly take it back and give the old one. In the routine section , first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately , but now all the days are one by one and not side by side , actually side by side is best and easy to edit , thank you for your reply :-).... Before it was as free but now as constant ad is placed below which is so annoying."
Easy to use. Helpful with dates and templates
"From the reviews, this app sounds awesome. Unfortunately, I can't use it because I need an app that syncs with Google Tasks."
"I wanted an app that would allow me to create grocery lists from web/desktop but access them from mobile. At the time of writing, this functionality still isn't fully working. Grocery lists are categorized on mobile, but the web version just shows a single list with all items mixed together. Auto-categorization has been working on mobile since 2018, but the developers still have not bothered to port this important feature to desktop. Also, I feel that far too many of the options are locked down for premium users, even trivial options like background colors."
"It needs to sync with outlook mobile calendar. It syncs with my samsung calendar, why not outkook?"
It helps me keep track of my tasks very efficiently :)
"I like the idea, especially the differentiation between dailies, habits, 
and to-dos, but I need to be able to see the history. Uninstalled - will 
stick to Daylio for now."
"Nice organizational app with lots of lists. I do wish it would save a task when you add it to a list rather than when you hit the button to save the whole list, I've lost some lists I wrote because I pressed back instead of save by accident. In general love the app though."
Works well but adverts are intrusive and annoying after using for several years now uninstalled and gone back to google calendar 😒
"nice, but there seems to be no way to hide declined events? that makes it much less useful. Would give 5/5 otherwise"
NO INSTRUCTIONS I can't even get started because there are no instructions. I put in list title groceries and that's it when I try to make a list it asks for sub titles won't let me even start a list just sends ya in circles DELETE DELETE
I just wish you could use this offline even if wouldn't record progress. Just make it accessible offline
"Was and is a great app. Used it for years, But now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff. Small ads down the bottom were fine, but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a HUGE NO for me. Uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts."
I always get an option to unblock instead of plant the tree when i press it it says that forest app has recently stopped !!
"I wanted to try out and see how it suits me, but when I was adjusting the start and end of the day, it appears that the end of the day is not beyond 2400. Ppl like me who sleep in the middle of the morning bcos of work tends to end work like 2 or 3am. Especially across different timezones. If that's fixed, I would be glad to pay for the app."
"The app is helpful and has nice features. I would give 5 stars but you apparently you are not able to transfer your lists to another device, unless you have exactly the same version. I had to create all my lists from scratch."
le partage est tres nul.... cest juste un texte envoyé a l autre...
"This app was everything I needed, I loved it. But after thenlast update I cannot log in to my account so I cannot see my daily schedule. Will not trust it again and I have already unistalled it. I need an organizing app which I can trust. Fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt.. So I dont know if I am forgeting something that is pending now."
"It's testing the edge of my patience. Even though I have better internet connection it keeps saying ""couldn't find the Internet connection. Try again later"". It's my first time. I can't sign in so I can't go in to the app and plan anything. Already I tried reinstall twice."
"Tasks cannot be ordered by their time. A habit not done is not shown as overdue. EDIT: I checked again to use it, but 1) Recurring task cannot be created. 2) Habits are shown like scheduled tasks. It's motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3) It's more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day. If we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once, it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1/2 (today), 1/60 (total) instead of 0/30 or 1/30."
I deleted this app and it still sends me emails everyday! Its a waist of time anyway
"5 habits for free version is not enough. Instead of limiting habits for free version, disable notifications or cloud storage or inter device sync, theme, calendar support and these similar abilities for free version."
"I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good ! I ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that, it's great. highly recommend if you, like me, like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks."
"I was scared when Wunderlist sold but honestly, it's even better now. It's complex enough to be valuable yet is still user friendly. I really haven't tried anything that has come close. Well done - whoever made this!"
I keep running into problematic bugs right away
"Now that we need to pay to lock other app while planting the tree, this app has lost it's purpose. I'll need to switch to another app next month."
it is difficult to set an event or goal without a tutorial
If there is some problem... regarding some phones than you must overcome that... Rest of all things application is great.
Doesn't Sync Anymore! & I Paid For The Pro Version... 😤
Excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones
"Great until last update. Love the app, its a great tool, but since the last update, I frequently get server error notifications, and the app doesn't function in any capacity (can't chat in party, dailies and habits don't refresh, etc.). rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue. I'd happily give this a 5-star if this could be fixed and I could get back to my daily log-ins and updates."
Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.
"honestly I don't write reviews often but this is an exception. this is a really good app if your looking for a to do list. it has a widget so you can put them on your home screen. you can put sub lists inside to do list items. when you complete something it says the date and time you completed it. you can color code them too. for me I have a to do list for every day of the week so I can stay productive all week. this app has everything I want and nothing I don't, it's a no brainer."
"I really love this app, but I can't find any way to make it work on my new (Huawei Y7) phone! I've followed all the instructions in the FAQ and tutorials online, but my trees still continue to grow regardless of whatever other apps I'm using. I hope this compatibility issue is possible to fix and that it gets fixed soon, because I absolutely love this app otherwise."
"Only rated 2 stars because of the ability to sync with the calendar apps on the phone and the ability to cross out any tasks once finished. However, the app is fairly simple with tasks laid out like a shopping or to do list with the inability to edit the timings of tasks. I had set an appointment for 1:30 but the app had automatically set it for 10:00 am and not allowing me to edit it. Also, it would have been nice for the tasks to be laid out in calendar format with color-coding options."
I love it! Would just be great if it also had a function where you can see your tasks in Calender format
"I do not have the premium version, but this app is great for helping me with my procrastination by setting goals with rewards, which in my case is decorating my forest, and helping me live up to them and not quit. It helps me set a goal at the start, and Ali's FINISH it and not get distracted or give up halfway."
widget is not working completely. It does not sync with the app. Plz solve this problem
"Boring and not very effective for me: the visual design is a bit of a yawn and it's too hard to earn rewards without paying. If it works for you, great but it doesn't give me enough gratification."
"An absolutely amazing app with even more amazing potential! I was looking for an app like this for a long time. No joke, enjoying my routines a lot more often ever since I started using this app. Thanks so much for this app!"
"Great app, very usable and straightforward, but I wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day. Seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging!"
Genuinely not a good app.
I would give it a 5 but I recently got a new phone and I cannot sync at all. I really needed it to sync. Very disappointed because I followed all the steps in my email. Please help
Like it
"I got the premium version The main drawbacks of this app are: 1- I cannot customize the categories 2- If I do a task earlier, it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3- removing done tasks is not available Just moved to the bottom"
I'm constantly finding little glitches in the game that throw off what I am trying to do when I am trying to earn points. Thank goodness for husband and siblings who have played this enough to know how to fix things when they go buggy but I don't appreciate not being able to go to customer service or send a quick email to help them update the system and fix it.
Nice app although the first sentence of the description of the app isn't nice. Life shouldn't be treated like a game.
To many features locked behind premium
"It takes too long to be fun, and sets you up for failure. At the start you are asked to create a small # of tasks. However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail. This is not discouraged as it should be, and there few goals at lower levels."
"ok so last review i said; 5 trees limit each user, even after i bought the pro version, no more trees after that and i dont think its fair. if you need anything about budget, we will help you by watching ads, collect coins or anything that will help you devs pocket to plant trees. subscription per month for price like the pro version price, i dont think people will dont care to put their money to invest this green movement. nature afterall is all we got. please consider my review, go trees🌱💚"
"It took me a couple of days to figure out how to enter information without data such as 'may' converting to 'date'. I simply had to tap on the word and it reversed the automation. I also found out by accident that a simple swipe down revealed all the sub-tasks that I was entering. I thought I had to go back to the main menu all the time. A simple 'start here first' induction video would be great but the more I practice, the better the app feels. Still orientating, early days yet."
"I have used this awesome app for 3 years at least. Sleek, convenient, powerful. But the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads. If that is not reverted soon, I will have to change app. Pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of other's great job. And thanks for your copy pasted answer 🙏"
there is scope of improvement to make it easier
Nice app
Relaxing
Excellent ap. Like the many configurations and the ap does well to monitor 10 different email accounts.
"I have planned some tasks, I've set a reminder and there is no reminder! The good thing is that it's more evolved than Wunderlist therefore I'm happy about it, however please fix this problem with the notifications"
"I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. £6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!"
I just need notification  tone more than these and much more long
It's good but has some points to improve.
"I liked, but in my cellphone had some bugs (galaxy A8+). I think if this app had a function to sync with the phone calendar (google calendar or samsung calendar) it would be much better"
An app that makes you pay for something for a feature as trivial as reminders cannot be considered as an usable free app
"Good app - the guilt over killing a tree is quite effective (for me, at least). Big wish though - the app forces the screen to stay on which drains battery life, but doesn't support horizontal screen orientation so plugging in the power cord to the bottom of my Galaxy s10 is super awkward. Please add horizontal screen support!"
Sound is not coming while the task is reminding.. How to get sound? without sound while reminding is not useful..please tell how to enable sound
Cant see my character
You want me to pay $5 for the full version so I can set a task to repeat? My phone's planner does that for free.
It doesn't work offline and when I'm actually online I need also a vpn to use it :-(
"It used to be a slick, minimal app that did what it needed to. Then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it. No thanks."
"Not sure why everyone's given this such high reviews. The reminders don't work for me, which makes the whole point of having this app useless"
"I needed a replacement for Wunderlist, which we relied on for task lists for our business & employees. With TickTick, I had to manually type in each task for each list because the Import feature only put them in my Inbox. There's no Home Screen - hitting the return arrow exits the app (not a biggie, just an adjustment). The real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person. Collaboration was an important feature we needed. Using Microsoft's To Do for now."
It's good but it's often stopping and not responding I'm irritated by this..I need to uninstall and reinstall everytime and sync..no problem with my device as it is new and good company..please try to fix it. I'm a pro user.
"Very simple UI. Potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time, some may like it scaled back look. Can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying. Seems costly for the simplicity of the app."
It's silly. Now I'm looking at my phone to see it the plant is growing. The plants are unrealistic. It did not help me stay focused during my Zoom mtg. I don't get it. Uninstalling...
"Been using the calendar for years now. The only problem is I can't figure out which app to keep, as I'm getting dual notifications from this app and Business Calendar Pro. What are the differences between Business Calendar Pro & Business Calendar 2"
"The time in the center of the widget, most of the time does not get updated. You have to open the app and then the widget is updated."
"Routine module and programming is nice. Any plans to make it a tracker app - log if the schedule event is accomplished completely, partially or not accomplished..? For example - drinking water few times a day. Exercising 1hr per day."
Decent todo app for single user. Home screen widget does not receive remote updates
"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off"
"Okay so... this is a good app, I just don't understand couple of things. First of all, ""My day"" - I feel like you could see there every task you have but just for that day, not for every day and it should be automatic. Also what's the difference between ""all"" and ""planned""? They are the exactly same lists. I wish I could order my tasks in all the lists not just at My day and/or add the time - it would help to plan my day more easily and made me do the hardest tasks first. Otherwise, a good app."
"It's a good app. However I'm disappointed that thr alarm doesnt ring and bevause i missed the remainder I had to pay overdue library fees! Edit: the app's creator is responsive and lovely 😊 thanks for the advise, Steve."
"Hi, i bought the premium version 2 days ago and now its not working, can u help me"
Easy to navigate in order to keep track of tasks.
Nice app to get focused.but gets closed if we try to select any plant.team pls focus on that issue😁
"Wunderlist migration/ Don't like Microsoft To Do. I really miss Wunderlist. I miss when I would save a link to Wunderlist and it would let me select the list I needed, not so in To-do. I'm trying to figure out how to leave To-Do for Trello or Todist. This is a bummer. Might just leave my stuff in To-Do and start all over again."
Very useful. Easy to plan daily schedule. Please keep on improving.
Very convenient app. Surprising number of features. Much better than just writing tasks on a notepad.
The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.
lost the ability to sort to dos by tags. very inconvenient. i used that feature a lot.
"Good and most practical application. But if app's widget could show date, day and current task and next task only or With customization option like that... This would be just awesome..."
It's okay
I am not able to link my gmail and Yahoo emails with it. If this feature is present please have a look at the problem and if this feature is absent please add it it makes tasks more easier.
It is a perfect app for organizing the routine. It is easy to understand the settings and has many customization options.
"Pro user here: I have 2 issues 1. After I clear/kill the app (swipe away in the multi-task mode) the Forest app ceases to work and I can use any other app. Please fix this. (Pixel 2 user) 2. Why can't Pro-users watch an Ad to double their coins? We should have the liberty to avail this feature too. I used to double my coins (by watching 30 second ads) before I paid for the app, and now I can't do it anymore. That's not fair."
You need to pay to add reminder/alarm which should be a basic feature
"Do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing ""subscriptions"" for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable? Do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app, like we used to see? Then this is the app for you! Add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about (and statistically speaking - you will) for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week"
previous it working very fine but now there lots issue with the application. eg. if you had not complete yesterday task it wont allow you complete today tasks even reporting is not working
"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits."
"This app crashes around 8 times a day. I got to re-install the app every time.Have got the pro version,and repenting for it."
"Very good application ... Only i facing issues is , it's won't work for offline ."
can somebody tell me why the heck wud this app wanna hv accesss to my gmail account???
Is there a way to get my money back? I don't like this app as much as a few others I have. ???
It does not ync eith al the calendars
"Simple to do list. It's ok, but you can't even edit tasks after you add them."
"I bought the Pro version and I'm so happy with this app. I can organise everything and it works with Gmail too. Beautiful, simple, easy to use and customizable! I'm using it since one year now."
"I have used it daily for over a year. It helps me be more efficient by not forgetting things I need to do or pick up at the office, the store, or for work projects. It also saves your lists on their server so if you lose your phone, your work is not lost. Highly recommended."
The app is great but after using awhile it start to lag.
"Been reinstalling and restarting my android for few times, nothing helps but keep saying ""Forest has stopped"" why?? I just installed it for less an hour though. Really need this app. Also been reporting. Please fix this"
"***UPDATE 5/29/19 - I decided to go ahead & do the trial so I could see how the location reminder works. So far I've tried about 3 different locations & none of them have updated. One of them was even my home. This was about 30 mins ago! I've been waiting for the app to work with Google Assistant. It's been saying""coming soon"" for quite some time. When this happens I may consider doing the premium. Until then the 7 day trial is pointless to see how the service completely works. Maybe one day...😥"
It is a great app but it force stops very frequently
"It is such a great app to help you manage your time! I really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way, it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday. One thing to point out will be the choice of the habit. Although you can type it yourself, wont really affect anything, I would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking ""other"". Also, it is sad that you need to pay for back up, but it is understandable."
cant get demo to play .its probably a great app..
Are there any guides out there?
"I've had this app for years- first the free app, now premium. I love being able to schedule tasks as well as events. I create different color-coded calendars for different categories of events, and it's really easy to sync calendars with my SO."
Too expensive.
"To be honest, it's a really good app. It has everything (simplicity, system, ui, etc.) but seriously, if this is really a productivity app, it needs to have an offline mode. Does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list?"
It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.
Been using the pro version for a long time and it's the best Android calendar out there. It has everything you need. No reason to look anywhere else.
Love the selections I have to highlight my different activities with color on my calendar.
Great app for organising the shopping. I like the way it automatically completes a task if all sub tasks get marked complete.
"Excellent work done by the Microsoft team, really wonderful. Just want a few upgrades, have an option to set a particular list or smart list as home-screen i.e. whenever we open the app we are directly directed to our selected list. And other is that make the app icon interesting, it is very much simple."
The program is really awesome but i'm using the oppo f7 and it doesn't do any notification i followed a guide but it didn't help that's the programs only problem
"I just installed this gem of an app this morning, and love its ease of use. However, there is a minor problem...the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar."
My entire plan was suddenly removed
"Dear developers, thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app! It was not pleasant at all, believe me!"
Sometimes gets dates wrong e.g religious holidays. Not as intuitive as others. Ok for basic use.
I liked the app well enough to pay for it so I could get my recurring items in order with it but when I set a task as recurring it only shows up on the day that I started with.
"It's really great, is helping me a lot to make a routine."
Does everything I want it to do and more!
The calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful
Those dots on the right of each item are gone. How do you reorder your to do items now?
"Clear problem with sync multiple platform , it just made me crazy"
"Good, better than the other apps"
It would be better if I could see a whole day shedule at once (maybe with applying two widgets that doesn't show the same period of time) or if I could croll time not only in the app but on the widget too.
I don't use Microsoft or Google calendars please integrate with time tree app calendar so I can use your app.
"Amazing app, only wish that when you search it would also look in sub task. Also would like Tags for both task and sub taks"
The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.
"It's helpful, but it's also annoying. Edit: I didn't make it clear enough, it's annoying to realize how much I'm failing lol Anyway the app is pretty good I'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal"
"App needs work, poor sync with website"
Synching between my Chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app. The color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive.
It takes some getting used to but then when you start thinking of it as an analog watch it sort of works.
"worked just fine until last month, but the feature to double coins through an ad is lagging a lot...I updated the app but the problem as persisted"
"It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment."
"Feature request: I hope I can manually reorder tasks in label views like it's done in project views. Of course, to be synchronized across all platforms. This will be cool."
How can i change the notification sound ?
👍
"Good at organizing tasks. The ""Highlight"" feature (and more importantly the ability to filter only highlighted entries) is great for managing to-do items."
"reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great 🙄"
What is this - NEXT ALARM (SYSYEM UPDATE)???
"I bought this because it has a really design and features, but I to uninstall it because it's slow loading. It's lagging."
Failed to open many times.. regretting for being subscribed user.. still problem exist..please rectify.. fed up with this app..please make sure that suggested version available.. it is only 4.18.1 available and I have to download the app for every 6 hours..worst appp
I like the calendar but get really annoyed at having to constantly change the colours as they keep going back to default.
I love Artful Agenda!!! It is the beauty and organization of a paper planner with the convenience of being online and on my phone! love the new featured that keep rolling out!
"Things were going great until I switched to a new phone .I can't find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone. I installed the app in my new phone and logged in, but the data is not there . I see that the events comes from the Google calendar, and I may be able to do something about that - but how do I sync the tasks ? Pls help."
"Quite good app, but recurring tasks which is a basic function doesn't work correctly, thus making the app useless. Even though I impremented all the instructions for Huawei still issue is there."
"looks great, but reminders/notifications are a premium feature. Google calendar is better."
Need to explore more
"The time in the center of the widget, most of the time does not get updated. You have to open the app and then the widget is updated."
"Great app BUT it takes away access to your data after a while unless you grant full access to email addresses/google acct/ everything. Fair enough request, but not by holding data to ransom. Either that or its been compromised by malware, but I don't think so"
"Just one thing.. ads are a problem, otherwise.. amazing, love it."
Its a very good app . It helps me stay focused . I like the features of this app . It is very easy to use . One feature which I personally love about this app is that we cannot exit this app until we are done with our work but if we did that that our tree will die . It also helps me stay productive . 👍👍👍
"Really amazing, but there are pop-up adverts if you're not a member, and for someone like me that's quite a few adverts daily. Very annoying!, But everything else is PERFECT. FYI The designers have to eat so I'm not mad but God damn that's annoying Would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you don't have to do it later. Just an idea id be up for."
Piece of poo
"I like it a lot, but I think it needs a way to tell what day you're in. It 
does ask if you did things yesterday, but I sometimes get reminders for 
things on the wrong days... It's still a very good resource."
Loaded the trial then emailed about cancelation but email bounced back. Ended up paying $36 for an app I didn't want. No way to contact for refund. Be careful if you buy this. If you try the trial you're stuck paying for it!
Uninstalled within 10 minutes of confusion. What to set where. Not user friendly. Not able to set routines daily programmes. Very confusing settings.
This app noticification sound didnt work...always silent and vibration ...i done everything
"Please add Data synchronisation with Google Drive...So, when we change device we can get our old Data on signing in"
"before was fine. it just happen today that widget shows 'widget loading...' only. i try to resize widget, then it's back. it just a little bug, but hope you can fix."
Don't like not being able to even look at the app without credit card entry and account sign up.
I can press middle button and start using Instagram and still count down continues
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving."
"Too complicated, too many details"
love love love this!!!! its the best of both worlds - paper and digital and syncs with all your calendars ! awesome app!
"first I was using this app but when I downloaded it after a long time then strange problems occured such as the routines remainder are not coming although it's option is on... also when I login back then a caption stating ""no authorisation provided to app"" is flashed... please tell me how to resolve it"
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved."
Loved it except that it wouldn't save and show me all of my events
Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive
"Very useful app for maintaining regular 'to do' lists. Adding a task is a breeze. The best thing I love most is YOU CAN ADD SUBTASKS WITHIN A TASK. Like if you want to finish a task in 4 steps, you can add each step as a subtask, and each can be marked as completed or not. You can sort the priority of a task by long pressing it and moving to the desired spot which is cool. And swiping a task towards left side deletes it, which is also cool. Super useful app for finishing your daily tasks."
Greattt app!!
Uninstalled due to frequent restart or login attempts
Used it for a fair amount of time without any problems. Suddenly then asked me to create an account or log using Google or FB. I used my Google one only to discover everything was gone!
"This app is fine in concept, but the ""game"" part of Habitica, arguably the reason you would use this app over other habit tracking apps, is just too boring and not that ""gamey"" to me, which doesn't keep me motivated to keep going back to the app for my habits. Concept is good, execution leaves much to be desired."
"Tried the basic version, liked it enough to buy the advanced version a week later!!! Best for the way I work, without distracting ""cutesy nonsense. "" I wanted a business calendar and that is what I got. STILL USING IN 2020."
"This is an amazing app. You're able to customize almost everything to what you want. There are some things I'd love to see added, though. Some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice, and being able to have a task directly award you with an item, too. Developer(s), if you see this you have done an amazing job, I'll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you."
"I like that it is easy and convenience which is what I'm looking for but I 
also need a way to run analytics of times spent on each task. Will change 
to 5 stars if that is possible."
it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.
There is no notification sound after break or time up.Please include this.
It works best till 5 to 6 hours but after a time that didn't stop ringing it is showing that your sittings block the time toon application it rings and rings till I uninstall this application..
Need a combination for habits and dailies
App has too many error to count.
برنامه عالیه اما اکثر امکاناتش پولیه
"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly."
A very great and easy to use app for tracking your habits. I am really happy 🖤
Good that i can link it across devices but i would very nuch prefer if there's a widget kind of thing which makes it easier to access
You guys ruined the Wunderlist app. You changed it in a way that is less useful for me and how I used this app.
"Неплохое приложение для поднятия своей дисциплины в игровой форме. Перейдем к минусам: - Дорого за полную версию Серьёзно, 3400 рублей за полную версию навсегда - это очень дорого! Мне кажется, что автор случайно дописал лишний ноль, 340 - ладно, 3400 - дрого. - Не всё доступно без полной версии... Это немного относится к первому минусу. Теперь плюсы: + Повышение дисциплины в игровой форме: Например, если быть чесным и выставлять адекватные награды, то всё очень классно!"
"Absolutely useless, worked once then never again. Am now living in amonst my household waste like stig of the dump 👍🏻"
"The #1 Best Habit Tracking app in my opinion. You can record the amount of activities you do and see the final result at the end of week. When recording your activities, It shows your average amount of the activities done during the week . This app also keeps my life back on track and reminds me what i need to do throughout the day and its very convenient. This app is extremely easy to use and it is free! I honestly wouldnt be able to live without it. Thank you. ❤️"
"I loved this app when I first got it. Though I still find it useful, the app vs desktop functionality leaves something to be desired. Still, I would have given a higher rating if the app didn't have a habit of moving tasks to a random calendar date instead of the one I selected. I'm not sure I'll purchase a second year subscription."
Really nice but need some more changes
Impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist. Thank you for screwing my wunder-lists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password
"Very Good app, if you're interested in a easy and very functional solution to plan out days ( like I do, or just for any type of task list. This is my #1 go to"
Notifications are great so far.
Excellent app. The first app in playstore that i got whuch reminded me of my tasks by alarm. Besides it also has to do list and pomodoro function in a single app! Loved it. Thanks TICKTICK team.
"I like the app but the only thing which i personally wanted was, if i were able to share picture with my shared tasks people, lets say i make a task to pay bill with my husband but i want to send him the image of the bill. Other than that better from other apps"
"Great app! Laid out well, lots of ways to change settings based on preferences, and super helpful! I use this for daily, weekly, and monthly tasks, and it has really helped me stay organized and cut down on list-making time. The only thing I wish was different is if weekly/ monthly items would reset after the due date rather than nightly, but I can just check/ uncheck them by hand."
Missing features from Wunderlist. Might need to find a new app.
"This app is amazing! Very convenient to be honest. Everything is just there for u to setup, the interface looks simple but great, especially the dark theme. I love it. One main thing about this app is that the premium section of it does not overwhelm the user. It's there but it doesn't shovel itself to the users face. Compared to the others I've used this is a better deal."
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain"
Great. Really helps me visually percieve all my tasks with time. Wish the interphase was more customizable tho.
it only lets you use it linked with Google calendar. You can't have 2 separate things.
"This app used to be great when paired with Alexa. Every once in awhile the sync would break but disabling the app and relinking the account would fix the issue. This has not been the case for the past several months. Any.do it is no longer syncing with Alexa and based on the reviews of the Alexa app it is affecting a lot of people, has been ongoing for weeks, and there doesn't appear to be a fix coming. Going to give anylist a try to see if it works with Alexa."
This app sometimes missed important tasks and didn't notify.
Is it possible to use this without connecting it to google calendar??
Its new I'll let you know later
Need to integrate with outlook calendar
Greatness
Nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with Google calendar and not cross platform. Certainly cannot do $15/yr.
Its a bad app at all!
I created a task for picking up groceries and set it to a specific day. Why in the world would the default setting in this app be to override my *do not disturb* setting and ring+vibrate at 5 o'clock in the morning on that day. Even though I like the apps functionality I would never recommend it to anyone with these default settings.
Not so good at all. How to enter stuff and completely useless. Very bad 👎 😕
Need more user friendly interface. But very useful application my mobile.
Nice
Best app for this need
Well this is awkward but I cant even find widget option for this app in phone. Downloaded just an hour ago so this has to be the latest version I believe. The whole purpose was to have a clock on my homescreen that has my calender synced. It doesnt seem to that. May be I'm missing something here? I'll definite give an update of this review if I can figured it out.
It dont have Alarm feature
"Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star."
Nice concept
"I missed my work today because of your stupid ""weak alarm"" method. This means I've lost some money. Notification reliability should be of paramount importance. If something doesn't work 100%, remove it. Very disappointed. VERY! Edit: I didn't get any warning, nothing. If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad. I'm forced to use the stock alarm for the first event in the morning to be sure, which is very inconvenient"
Hi. I love the application. I am planning to buy the pro version. I'm just wondering if the pro version is a one time life time already
"Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues"
"the app is good ,but it would be better if it had a timeline (Please do something about that)"
why I gotta sync
"This is really helpful for me to get productive and focus on my academics. But recently, the app has been having issues. After using the app for a few times, the app suddenly crashes every time I try to open it and then I can't use it anymore. I tried to reinstall the app a couple of times to make it work again. But the same problem happens again after using it a few times. Please fix it."
"I've been using the app for quite a while, and it seems to work well with Google Calendar, showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs. While I have not experienced any issues and the widget is a must-have on my home screen, customisation options are very limited for free users. That's not a big deal, but I do wish we had at least a bit more."
"This app has replaced my chaotic stream of notebooks, carted around in my various bags until their covers fall off and I no longer know where to find anything. I upgraded to the premium version after using the trial month and never regret it. In addition to syncing with my GCal, I have the tab pinned in my browser so I can organize and share notes across my phone and computer with ease. At the day job we use Asana, but Todoist is my choice for both personal projects/hobbies and freelance work."
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Generally good and useful with a clean interface but there's a phenomenally annoying bug where tasks often ping all the way to the bottom of your list when you're trying to drag and drop them.
Best life rpg app that I could find. Support is very helpful and fast at responding. Everything other app I tried was all about them milking money. But not this one.
Absolutely love this app. So much productivity.
It seems so cool and I wanted to use it as soon as possible but it wont even let me log in. It takes 1second to load and then nothing happens
"The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker."
Fine
"I love the interface, the overall concept and easiness of interface. Rewarding and fun to use, has helped me alot with my life goals!"
The app is just awesome now. Thank you seekrtech for fixing the bugs
Does not sync with MS Exchange calendar
Great
"How soon until the list sharing is available? If soon, you have just earned a small business customer."
"I love the app but please, allow me to just buy the app and be on my way, what's up with the subscriptions?"
"Great little app! Love the sounds, in particular cafe Paris. I did have some issues- twice had to reboot, once because the sound wouldn't stop, and once because it never stopped bringing me back to the app. But all in all a great app."
"Love it , just need to increase habits option"
It's simply the best for time allocation to activities and routines.
Fun
After an update started showing really annoying full-screen ads. Been using it for quite some time. Will uninstall
"The ease of use for everyday things is great, I have a note pad, task pad and calendar and I just set a task to call back a customer after hrs.. Sure it might note be a flashy business planner but if you just want something to remind you of events store something quickly for later reference, what more do you need, so far any ads haven't been intrusive the main reason people stop using these kind of apps"
Reliable and adaptable
No es intuitiva
"Cannot share entire calendar and/or task database with other users. Only single daily task shares or individual list collaborations. Edit: very solid low 1 star, 0 if I could, since the developer couldn't even be bothered to read the entire of two sentences of review, acknowledging what features they did have."
Good
its a great app but need to add a version were you can restore your notes if lost my app got erased by accident and i dont have any of my notes saved please consider adding to the app
A very good but incomplete idea. There is no way to track time spent on certain habits. there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour... Besides the statistics are super limited and basic.
The hourly reminders don't work properly. They show up sometimes and sometimes they don't. It's unreliable that way. Otherwise the app is quite nice.
Worst app
"Definitely not for me, it was confusing. But hey if you are a gamer and suffering from mental health stuff. its for you"
"Seems like it may be a good app, but I uninstalled as soon as I found out you have to pay a monthly fee for recurring reminders (which is developed once and costs nothing to maintain)"
would like to change my my class and chat is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate. a simple notification system would make it easy.
Good
Please add today's task to my day automatically. Now it has to do it manually.
it is helpful.
"I'm using it for planning my job and it really helped me with scheduling the tasks, very useful app"
"I had and paid for the premium version back then when it was called ""Habit Bull"" I loved it but since now they changed to ""Habit Tracker"" I no longer have the premium add ons and they expect for me to pay again. No thanks."
Why does it keep crashing!!! Please fix i am premium user and it annoys me to keep reinstalling. In general i support the cause behind this app and easy application. Looking forward to hear back from you. Best Regards Adriel
you basically can't do anything if you don't buy the full version.
Really weird formatting? I'm trying to be MORE organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app
"This is the only app that does what it does and I love the functionality. The only problem is the app is quite buggy and I haven't seen or noticed any updates in years. Would also be nice if there was a website to go with it. I am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks. If google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better, that would do it all."
"There were a lot less options for handwriting, covers, and stickers than I anticipated for something you want me to pay an annual or monthly subscription for. It's a great concept but the execution fell short for me."
"Great app, easy to use. Custom colours and categories for each habit. Limited to 5 habits on the free version is the only gripe"
"it just opens a-calender, so I'm not sure why I need something between me and my regular calendar app."
ITS G R E A T. I LOVE THIS APP.
Lousy app
"App works but I got very disappointed after I purchased the premium features only to discover that sync between devices doesn't work, and that the app developer is completely unresponsive to my support requests, so I wasted my money and am not able to get a refund."
Clean and simple view of my day - absolutely amazing tool for keeping me focused. Wish I'd found it sooner.
"Just as I was about to rate this 5 stars, it only let me have 16 ""subtasks"" It's stupid. Let us have more ""subtasks"" and I'll give you guys 5 stars."
Downloaded the app and the server just did not want to connect and synch my to do list and habits. Gave up after 10 mins.
Terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit? Stupidly paid for the premium upfront. Agree with others that idk where 4.6 came from.
Heavy
"I'm using this app for work for Due Diligence. When I first installed the app I was sure I could ""search"" my notes for key words now I can't. Am I doing something wrong or is that function not available on this app?"
"Ok, I guess."
Can anyone explain 'any.do moment' and 'plan my day' option in the app??
"I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free."
"limits habits to like 6 or whatever unless you pay, useless"
"I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app."
I cannot re-edit the date like i used to in the last update please fix it. I want to edit it from the text box not from the calender.
"The app doesn't have any option to notify you, so last I played I had difficulty forming habits"
Still trying to get used to the app.
Limited Habits
Will be happy if this app comes with time duration..other that this is a perfect app with which one can easily create tasks
overall decent experience. main areas I'm not happy with are ui design choices. lots of wasted space and navigational steps that could be improved. Wish i could see the content in more compressed format. also no night/dark theme which is important to me when using an app i night pull up before going to sleep or in early morning.
You have to subscribe for the pro version. I'd rather just have one flat fee
"Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps."
When i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesn't remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper
I paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didn't work properly. Come to find out that the pro version doesn't have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does. But the paid version does color code. Gaining that feature isn't worth losing the other two. I feel robbed.
Does not store none tasks information well.
i got no notification
Good app but I can't get it to shade in the entire timeframes of my activities like in the photos here. It only has a line at the end time.
"Ever get a phone call from a Salesman whom you don't remember giving your phone number out to? this is the app that does it. it reads your phone number and identity and uploads it to the cloud where it can later be sold to the highest bidder. this app makes sure that it gets your identity because you have to login before you can even use it. once you log in, the game is a huge disappointment. mypoli has everything over this."
"I'd be lost without this app. Love it, keeps me organized"
"A good app. But the rewarded ads are too sensual and sexual content. I know you people charge money from those social chatting apps, but your team can ask them to show ads which are more creative rather than simply attracting through sexual content since most of the people who use this forest app are focused oriented and they will surely not going to like such ads on such a good self improvement app."
"This is a great app and it really helped me do my tasks but it doesn't work properly. For example when I try to move a habit so that the list is in the order I want it to be, the app glitches and the habit is sent back to the top. I know those problems are almost insignificant but it gets seriously annoying sometimes. Fix those little problems and I'll give this app the five stars it deserves."
Good app
Because it takes aiges to download😂😂😂
The Reminder option is not working....I have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but Unfortunately....The basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent work....kindly help by resolving this issue... Color code Options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit
"Reduced to 1 star after second repetitive dev response. (edit after dev response) I get having ads, but full screen ads that you have to wait to skip are very annoying. I am fine with ads that appear at the bottom. Great app until the full screen ads appeared"
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
Really is a great tool. Needs a way to export to excel and time tracking per task.
I'm sure this would be a great app... if you could actually use it. But it only allows you do add things from another calendar making it useless if you don't have one.
I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes
still trying
Good
Good app. They finally fixed the major issues around linking it to your Outlook account. I like the My Day functionality. Adding subtasks works great! Works on all my platforms seamlessly. Allows and remembers user sorting of tasks for those that go in an order. Very well done!
Awesome
great concept
"A nice, solid, basic app for tasks. I enjoy the features of being able to have different projects, priorities and easy scheduling. The push notification doesn't seem to work unless I've recently opened the app, so usually I get a notification of the day's tasks after I've already opened the app to check manually. I'm on a Huawei android. That's a big minus unfortunately."
"Tried a few different personal productivity apps, this is the first which feels like it will stick."
Dark mode should not be a paid for feature in any app. Otherwise this app is ok but feels pretty unintuitive.
No updates long time ago
Easy to use. Great for creating new routines and habits
I really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago. all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened. I have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now. please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app.
"Find another app. Wunderlist was much better. When you sort alphabetically then prioritize an item, it doesn't move to the top of the list. Wunderlist would allow sorting and when it was starred, move to the top."
"The app design looks nice, and has good features. This is a functional planner app. I can access the week view in the free version (though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up), but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version. This is a main feature I'm looking for in a planner app. Also, the look of the app cannot be customized- stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen. There are other free apps that include these things."
Magnifique👌
"Cute, love it but bugs, no alarms that's the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me."
Don't like the new changes.
It's amazing
A hidden wonderful music comment and feedback is correct please do it like previous it was
"Trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what I set it as. Trying to change the date back just creates a second event. Then trying to delete both events takes several tries, because half the time they don't actually delete. This is really annoying."
A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.
Excellent app
Amazing app..it helps me to concentrate on my work and get rid of my mobile during study time
Keeps me organised very happy with would be even better if it had functions to support Dsylexia sufferes.
"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled."
I just switched from Wunderlist. Why cant I share my list with my family to add or delete from?
"I am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control. Edited to add: of course the free version has ads. Always has, and I don't mind, because *something* has to pay for app development. But these new full page, video that can't be shut down, in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable. That was a bad business mistake you can correct. I hope you correct it soon. I'll be checking back to see."
This is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me. I found a free app that does tbe same things.
Repeated to do list do not appear on My day. I missed few. That option should have been there
The application should ask for all required permissions for populating the task reminder. Currently I was struggling for getting an auto population of task reminder. So uninstalling same.
"Very motivational, but what's with the subscription fee!? Fifteen dollars a year??"
It is a good basic list app which is all I wanted. Really like the sharing aspect.
After recent update this app not working properly...(Recent Tasks & Reminder not working)
GREAT APP HELP ME DURING QUARANTINE SO MUCH.
"It would be higher rating but I can't delite some events I don't need anymore.... For example: I still have reminder to pay a credit card which I don't have anymore for 2 years!!!!! If there is a way of deleting the same, please tell me, I'll give it 4 stars. Also too complicated (time consuming) setting exact time you want a reminder for an event...."
"I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app."
Please fixed it. Why i can't login my passcode. Damnly. Alot of doc i ve save inside
I have been using Artful Agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features. Now the app makes it even more accessible. I love planning meals and mapping out my day!
SO helpful in tracking my goals! I was just looking for something inexpensive and super basic but there are a bunch of features I didn't even know about that make it way better than basic and TOTALLY worth the price. Try it!
After the update it is crashing most of the time I open the store.
Needs a setting to repeat the task
"Very awesome so far! I really love how customizable this is. It does so much it takes a while to learn how to utilize all the features, but I am super happy 👍. Hope it continues to be great with continued use."
Good
"I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this, but the app glitches CONSTANTLY with Chrome OS. Whenever I flip to ""My Day,"" the suggested tasks flicker on the screen and make using the app impossible. I used it on my Android phone and previously on my Macbook with no problem. I loved the ""My Day"" function and am loathe to switch to a different app, but I don't think I have a choice."
Very useful but completely loses it's value when you don't get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others. Other times you don't even get any I mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you don't even get the reminder? Please fix this problem.
"The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything."
"Used to work ok, now, something is skrewy. Now, if I restart my phone, EVERY SINGLE task comes up as a notification, never mind of when the tasks were/are due, and the schedule I set. Now, after I dismiss tasks, they pop up again, ignoring its schedule. Also, wish app could remember which day the task is for. If you have a daily task that you complete after midnight, it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day. Finally, wish app opened to an overview of all lists."
"I'm coming from Wunderlist, which I loved. This is an okay replacement, but there are two things that should be improved. The My Day list doesn't populate automatically with tasks that are due today, which doesn't make sense to me. You have to manually add them to your day (even though you've already set the due date.) Also, I miss having my tasks separated by list on my day view so that I can easily see what's on my work list, home list, etc. Right now they are just all jumbled together."
"This is cool, I'm on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading. You can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity, as well as penalties for failure. You can even link customizable titles to your level progression (my personal goal: Archwizard of the Order of Ptolemy). Very few features are locked behind the paywall, and everything that is essential is free."
not bad
"I used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive, taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything. I guess I'll go back the regular Google calendar app. Reply to developer: that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads. For now I'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps."
best habit tracker ✓ edit- can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph? It's not accurate- always trending down no matter what.
When ever I go for more than 1 hour it gets crashed Pls do something
Nice reminder app. Easy to use and categorise tasks 🙂👍🏼
It only works when linked to another calendar app....and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm.....
"I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone..."
"Lost my custom lists and tasks after the current app update... Like the app otherwise but if it wipes your info, then whats the point? Update: was still there online, signed out of the app and back in. Its all there now!"
Works well until you purchase Pro. After this all your calendar dates are displayed one day ahead (your events on a Monday in your Calendar are displayed on Sunday).
Automatic synchronisation disabled by developers 🤕
"We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity."
"Annoying, obstructive ads. got fed up after one had a fake X button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it."
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.
Really a great app for task management🔥🔥
"As a user of GTasks (owned by TickTick), how do I FULLY synchronise my data with the cloud (preferably Google but will make do with the TickTick servers). I pay for this service but only 40% of my tasks are backed up on TickTick server/cloud. Any and all advice much appreciated. kind Regards John Collington"
Love creating all kinds of lists for different reasons and being able to share with others. It has been wonderful having a grocery list created for my parents we share because I've been doing their shopping during Covid19. Also love the different background photos to choose from!!
Easy to use and does exactly what it says.
"This is an amazing app. You're able to customize almost everything to what you want. There are some things I'd love to see added, though. Some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice, and being able to have a task directly award you with an item, too. Developer(s), if you see this you have done an amazing job, I'll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you."
I am so confused
Same old Microsoft. The app does not have independent storage but uses cell phone's gallery for attachments..... No grouping of starred items per list. No assigning task to person. No ability to manually move important list items. NOT GOOD.
Good app but needs to add daily To do List
Appearance good. Sometimes lags and don't update the time even after an hour.
Great app! but there is an error when I try to open the store to unlock new trees or songs it says (error: 664) I hope to fix that problem soon
I bought the premium. And I can't sync the data between my devices.
My alarm isn't ringing please help. Everything else is fine
Its really a good app. Worth using. Everything is fine but I found a problem : it notifies tasks with a notification sound not a music tone. So one not even know if it has notified if the person is a bit far away from the phone. That's it.
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying
"TickTick is not a bad app by any means, but it is too complicated for my needs, so I just went back to using Google Keep, which also has an excellent sync system with its website equivalent. TickTick is especially complex when it comes to the scheduling of alerts, which always confused me to the point where I didn’t understand how to set the reminders that I wanted. TickTick is a fantastic app, but it is quite confusing. I prefer simplicity in the note-taking and reminder apps that I use."
Not so great. The user interface is not friendly. Making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way (that i found) to make a list that repeats daily. I'll just stick to google keep.
Good
Why on earth when I'm on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default? just why?
"I love this, it has legitimately helped my focus and productivity a ton during this pandemic. I had a lot of trouble focusing at home when my college went online, but this is simple, clear, pretty, and very satisfying. The free version has all I needed but I upgraded just to support the people who made this. I use this daily, even months later. I've recommended it to family, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs some help staying motivated and focused during all this!"
"Using the app since years, now whenever open the app, trying to save an entry, full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates, this app is at its worst"
Used it for years. Great app but uninstalled it after they added adds during editing appointments... I use a different app now...
Why so expensive? Microsoft Task or reminder offer most of the features that this app has. Could you please decrease the price a little bit? Or give me some discount? Atleast for the first Year?
"wish the reminder have had a repeat function(e.g. every week), so I don't have to recheck the tasks"
"Max of 9 lists, then you pay 3 bucks a month."
"Waiting for the bug to be fixed which causes the tasks to be moved out of order and disappear,otherwise great app."
Should be available in landscape mode too
Best app 😍
It's great to have an app that allows me to keep track of my to-do list everywhere I go.
"I miss having what used to be starred items organized by the file they are listed under. Now its one massive Iist under important. While the category is there, it was so much nicer under Wunderlist. Please, I hope you bring that feature back. Thank you."
"Sound now works but when I have the phone's Do Not Disturb feature on my wake up alarm task notifies but no sound. I have it set to ignore Do Not Disturb and have it set to alarm. My other alarm app does sound off during this time but not as reliable as Task, so it's not my phone causing no sound issue, what else could it be Stephen? You get it working and you get 4 stars, restore still does not work, gave up on that."
It is confusing.. I ws looking forward to get a list of tasks so tht I can mark it done or not done. 2nd review after receiving feedback from Dev. Steve: Steve I think I don't hv tht much time to personally write to u and I guess thts why play store has review system. I hope this helps. Thnks. If possible try to b polite to ur future customer.
Can't import/sync w/ Google Tasks?
I have just downloaded this app and I can't register. Is there a reason for that?
"Love this app! It's quick and easy to enter tasks, and when I assign a due date/time the reminders pop up to let me know is urgent or due now."
Love habit forming features! Wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists.
"Can't sync anymore, and all my lists are gone after I relogged (no lists when I log in through the browser either). Tried ""Get help"" but no reply for several days now."
"nice app but after enabling it, whenever i tried to open clock from taskbar this aap gets open instead, which i don't what"
Go forward and conquer google keep
"I paid for the premium to save my data to upload to my new phone. Didn't work, deleted ALL of my info and when I reached out to tech. support, no response..."
Has trouble syncing Google calendar. Not all events show up even after clicking sync now. Also tried hiding and un hiding calender but still doesn't sync.
I'm experiencing issues with the reminder option. Whenever I set a reminder I get neither the notification or the popup which as a result makes me forget things. This issue wasn't there before. What can be done to solve this?
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!
how to view statistics?
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app
"Does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics: it only shows 24hrs (12hrs in free version). Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management."
This app doesn't work the way we won't. It doesn't notify after even permitting it.
It's good but Tasks should appear in Outlook calendar rather than having to switch between apps. Should merge both apps.
I want to learn about it
"just downloaded. seems to be a simple task / to do list that I was looking for. QUESTION. how do I get the app to be an onscreen Widget, which is shown on the screen shots above?? Thank you"
Lousy app
"Really awesome app, I think the best one. The only it lacks web version, since it takes kinda complicated process to create and manage all this tasks and habits. With web version it would be much easier."
It's a great organizational tool
Too many items
"I like the idea how it shows my skills but I hate it when it organize the tasks in orders, it sets up automatically wherever it wants. Manual task organizer should be available."
It's good app But it's not free if you want to add more than 5 habit
"Extremely helpful app from Microsoft's garage. This is my go to app for scheduling tasks, managing grocery list collaboratively. It's extremely helpful because I get access to my list of tasks from my computer too. And the best part of all, it's totally free. I give 5 stars here, highly recommended 👍🏼"
"Very good app. The synchronization with outlook is not always happening, somehow, but it is generally very reliable."
Wow! I love how well it integrates with Google's Home products. Verbally adding items to my various to do lists as well as my grocery list is awesome!!
"I absolutely LOVE this app! I am a very OCD person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital...very portable and environmentally friendly... I found it here! I love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices, phone, iPad, Google home device, and laptop. It’s super user friendly and very customizable! I tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down!"
"it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task"
"App was excellent till recent, but I'm unable to add new task after recent updates."
"When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C."
Syncing in the background between Android and Mac hasn't worked for months. Have to manually go into the Android app and do a sync. Doing a background sync on Android after every edit or notification that gets updated would be nice.
"Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app."
this app not sending me any notification.
Fine! *_*
"By far the best habit building and tracking app I have used and I have tried many. Have been using the paid version for 6 months or more and my routines ane habits are the best of my life. You need more than an app, but having a tool like this is KEY. LOVE the flexibility, simplicity and the streak-oriented design. Thank you HabitBull!"
It is awesome super helped me But I have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them
car
It's good but i think it would be better if the routines could be sorted
"I think it could be more user-friendly, but maybe I haven't explored it enough. It keeps asking for a rating maybe it will stop now."
"Please fix the date format, we're not all backward Americans..."
"Uhmm...hello creator... I just want to ask when I opened the app, it glitches and it will turn back to my home. Please fix this thank you"
"This is one of the best apps for self improvement available for gamers. The idea, the execution, the design, amazing. My only gripe is that the error messages you get only sorta explain what went wrong and I have not successfully used the stat correction page once. Always error messages. Hopefully these bugs get worked out."
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.
Ok
"Just Downloaded so far great, but I'm looking for an application I can use between two or more, i.e. minors etc. Where I can send a task via messenger for example. does this app upload if the other user also has Task?"
"Suddenly the widget I have been using for years is gone. Every time, I update, I am worried of losing the widget or data"
Jibj
very smooth and elegant. works perfect as your daily planner
Super helpful for me. Im bad at doing things in a consistent manner but this app has helped me keep track of things. Its daily reminders are also super helpful.
"I have autism and downloaded this app to help mange my tasks and routine, but after trying to work it out for 10 to 20 minutes, I've decided it's not for me. I couldn't set a very simple habit of brushing my teeth twice a day, or a reminder to stretch twice a week on certain days of the week. Not as straight forward to use or set up as it seemed."
"I deleted a list but I still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list, even after restarting my phone."
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain"
"Wasn't sure to begin with, as it's not all that user friendly... but how frustrating to take a chance anyway & pay for premium only to have it NOT sync with my Calendars....! Wasn't really any other reason to pay for premium except that.... What a small waste of money; it's of no use to me now! 😒"
"This app just ""disappeared"" two of the recent events I listed in, both weddings. Luckily I thought of rechecking a day after inputting them. This has happened a couple of times already. Too unreliable for work appointments, I might get fired when I rely on this app's widget for work appointments. Close to uninstalling, after I check out a good replacement"
"After the task time is over, the app without giving the relax time shows that the relax time is over. It usually happens alternate manner."
"Good BUT... STILL does not handle repeat events such as Daylight Savings Time change (i.e. setting a reminder for the second Sunday of March each year to change clocks that don't adjust automatically). Does not handle ""last day of the month"" reminders well. Also, the list should display an icon by repeating tasks. Backup options are very limited, does not handle integration with e.g. Dropbox. Otherwise it would be perfect for my needs."
It's great for to do lists and categorizing them.
Good
This app helps me to micromanage my tasks and organize my life! You can color code your lists too which makes dividing tasks more pragmatic and visually appealing. It's great! I love it and I continue to get so much more done by using it. I highly recommend it! 4.5+ stars!
"couldn't change time zone, its an hour ahead and no setting to select my time zone"
"This task/project management app revolutionised my life, brought about a clear judgement for prioritizing and balancing work & personal life. My favourite is the recurring task functionality which is excellent for habit creation but not also building consistency in project management. 4/5 cuz I haven't used the premium version yet."
Not Making an Account!
"I cant open this app in many times, what happen??? Pls fix that mistake quickly"
"Loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks 
without instantly crashing so I'm not using it anymore. I'll be sure to try 
it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn't present next time. 
😊"
Easy to use. Thank you so much for the app and for helping me lead a healthier lifestyle! :)
I got a best friend in daily practice
"Amazing, creative and motivating. Kudos Designers love the Gameboy pixellated feel really made me nostalgic. Amazing app"
"Easy to use, I only use it for the to do list but its perfect."
It's very helpful and helps in time management ☺️
"Simply amazing app. Intuitive combined with necessarily complex, for all levels of users. I also bought pro and look forward to using it (good that you can pay, it gives the devs incentive to support and improve the app) Love it, very clean and useful!"
"I just got the app and it is truly and honestly great! I'm super disorganised but this has really allowed me to consolidate all of my tasks. An incredibly smart, entertaining yet useful, and engaging app. I truly can't oversell it and now I really wanna stop writing this review to go level up my character. I want a staff!!!!"
Numerical entries should default to the previous days value
Very nice
"Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system. It has helped me better myself over the past week of using it, so I'd highly recommend trying it, at least in the limited free version before buying the full version."
best
"I've been using it for more than a year now and it's great. My productivity has improved since I know exactly what I needs to be done and when. Been using the free version so far, because I didn't need the other features so far. But I'm really considering buying the full version"
Nice
"One of the most expensive apps I have ever seen or tried. Everything costs money. Subscription? Check. Paid themes? Check. I mean, I spent a fortune on apps, and I am in favor of continuous support, but still. Losing my lifetime savings is just not okay. Reminds me of the app Newton Mail where they went from free to Oh My God This Is Expensive. IMO users would sub way more if the options were affordable. Sorry for 2/5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices, I can't say that it's an ok app"
The app doesn't work properly although i follow the instructions of setting. Sometimes it can block the other apps while I'm planting trees. Sometimes just doesn't.
One of the main bugs in this app is that the widget's time doesn't update on its own. And the time gets stuck at any point.
"Latest update is super buggy; can't change if I want my dailys to be every 2 days, 3 days, etc. because the keyboard jumps up and immediately disappears. Really annoying."
"its a good app, the cool thing for me is that you can comment per day, so if you fail with your habits you can find out what things stand in your way, i withdraw one star because i want to make a feature request: when you select ""all habits "" i also want to see all comments (mixed) this way the app would also be a holistic diary , thx :-)"
"Finally! The supplement to the Outlook app. Integrates well with creating tasks and flagging emails. I'm finding it faster to manage tasks from my Note 10 over the normally used desktop version. I'm now able to manage from my mobile device without being strapped to my laptop. Nor do I have to wait to boot up laptop to process emails, thought, or create tasks. Thank Microsoft for increasing my production. I just started using it today and excited for future use while working from laptop."
"Too confusing, too many categories. Going back to Wunderlist if I can. I liked Wunderlist better. There was more logic to it."
Wood I luv this app cuz now I am well organised n I plan all my project work in. As a student I would advise others 2 download it 2 make ur life more well organized . Thanks a lot ticktick
"Great app, but we should be able to customize list image from our device and customize notifications ringtone, anyway it is a good app, it would be great if you add this"
"I really like this app, as it helps me stay focussed. When did it become obligtory to create an account to buy anything from the shop? Even having bought premium doesn't change that..."
"Amazing system, some what hard to balance custom goals without someone else's help. But fun and helpfully none the less ."
really good app really helpful. but guys if you can change the reminder Sound from notification to Alarm. plzz
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.
"Do not use this app, lost all my data (something like 3 years) go ahead and read other have the same problems, I even have premium. Now its impossible to login back with FB or email. Really, really disapointed. Developers dont answer any emails."
It stopped showing reminders and notifications!!!!!
"The app works with the exception of showing all events on the app. The widget show 12 (9 hours ahead and 3 hours passed.) So when one views tomorrow's schedule in the evening, the app does not show tomorrow mornings event or anything prior to 3 hours before the current time the next day. (A bit of a mouthful but those with full schedule will know what I mean)"
"Please make the widgets more customizable and make us able to change the background transparency. Edit: Looks like you didn't understand. I'm talking about the background transparency of the widgets. Again, if you didn't understand - I'm talking about the ability to change the background transparency, the blackish background which makes the contrast higher and isn't necessary on wallpapers which aren't too bright."
"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. 🤓"
"My phone keeps blocking the apps action no matter what I do. It keep showing it was blocked, troubleshoot, and refresh background task."
There were no Ads when I installed it and now every time I put my schedule there is Ads so I need to wait. It's very annoying!!!!! I will find another app.
"Does what it needs to do. Very good integration with Google Calendar. The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task. Not being able to send emails as a task from different (g)mail accounts is a feature I miss. But overall very good app. Hence 4 stars."
Suddenly the app will stop working and I have to reinstall it again. And each time I install this app I'm loosing my data . App is excellent but this issue is horrible. I already sent mail addressing this issue but no response and same thing is repeating. I'm facing the same problem again. It's horrible. It's becoming worst it's not at all working
Nice one but I can't amend schedule days after habit saved.
"Best productivity app I've found, goal progress tracking, hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better"
Great App
Good app but eventually stopped using it as it didn't fit my needs exactly.
