"OK, I love the app, it's great, but the notifications just doesn't work, they are broken, and it's the main feature I'm looking for, fix it in order to give you the five starts"
Way over priced for what it does. Not worth it!
"So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars"
Some daily tasks just disappear a minute after I tick them. This bug is affecting me for about a week now and I'm already tired of it.
Excellent replacement for Wunderlist! A nice feature would be to automatically delete completed tasks from certain lists...or an option to print only the active list. On my iPad I nearly hit print with 400 pages of completed tasks! Other than that it's perfect.
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first."
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep
I love the concept & look of this mobile app & the desktop version. I wish I could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks. You also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into Artful Agenda. You have to add it to your Google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to Artful Agenda. I've paid for the year subscription & I'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or I won't be renewing.
This app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save
"Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts"
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
"I don't know why but this app doesn't function well on my phone. I have enabled all the settings but whenever I try to open this app it says ""forest"" keeps stopping. I love this app, but I want a way out of this problem."
The tutorial looks simple and a good layout but when I make an entry 9 out of 10 times it disappears and I need to re-enter it. Half the time dosent work
Good one
this app sucks
"Calendar has a lot of good features but half the time my reminders don't go off so I miss them. Paid for the full version but it still didn't help. All of my Friday reminders finally chimed on Sunday, kinda pointless!!"
Bom
I'd rather have continous ads than a payed time subscription. Honestly the subscription seems pretty shady for somethng you can easily do yourself... $3.69 for a month subscription and $36 bucks for a yearly subscription? Seriously? Why not just pay a premium one-time payment costing $10? Pathetic.
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.
shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly. otherwise all around good app.
The app really nice.....i request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders
"Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet."
The free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders... Kind of pointless. I'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium. The layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives. I would have considered buying if there was a one-time payment model.
"Ive used this app a couple times now, only uninstalling because school ended, but this app is amazing when it comes down to it. It encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others. Plus, it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with/rpg game like elements."
"Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for...."
"I think it's a great app, and a lot of fun. I had some trouble figuring things out at first, but everything works. The only complaint I would have is the cost... It would be nice to have some of the features, but they are too expensive."
Everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
This app stops working everytime I install it. I have already taken its subscription but now everytime I open it crashes. I have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isn't solved.
"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all."
"Really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. However, I did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days. Everything else you can edit,..time, date, category, but wanted to change my days and I had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5☆s"
"This app really draws my attention. Forest not only sends out meaningful messages (protect the green environment and save the future), but it is also a friendly reminder for me of staying focused on study and work, instead of being distracted."
"This app is brilliant! Clean, simple, and ultimately customizable. I've been wanting something like this for a while!"
"I love the app but recently the widgets have been glitching, they go blank or sometimes do respond when I click a checkbox."
Laggy.
Think its great but keeps going black and crashing all the time!
"This has everything I'm looking for from a UI perspective except one key thing: the ability to invite someone else to add/complete list items with you. It's the function Wunderlist fulfilled for us and I've been looking for a replacement ever since they were bought by MS. Add it, and it will be the dream list app I want!"
Notification is not of up to my expectation. Need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it... Besides that.. The way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect. I do love to continue using it if they update the notification part.
Nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app
loving it so far! keeps me motivated :)
"This app is so cool! It's geared towards complete configuration from the user, so give your goals the time they deserve and map it out. Once you get through learning the app, it will be an awesome tool for your future development!"
I've been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird. I don't receive reminders anymore and it's completely a waste of time to set reminders! Not very reliable right now
"The program is very good on my old phone(galaxy note 4), but notifications don't work on the new one(redmi note 8 pro). I hope you will fix them. Thanks"
"I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys."
"I very rarely leave reviews, but I have to say this is the best ""to do"" app I've ever used in my life. I've even tried all the popular ones and they didn't work for me like this one does. The notifications are amazing and I love that I can snooze them."
Good interface and design. But the sharing capabilities were riddled with issues. The app became almost unusable if you tried to share anything
Nice one
Very simple setup and gives you an idea of where you have time in your daily schedule.
"Came from Wunderlist and, to no surprise, Microsoft has managed to cause issues. My wife and I create ""tasks"" as shopping lists and they take quite a bit longer to sync than they used to if they even sync at all."
"I signed up for the pro: $30/ year is on the bordreline for me, but i feel it is worth it if it can make me even 15% more organized or disciplibed. It has some very good features and flexibility: 1) Kanban view of projects sold me; 2) a nice habit maker capability, 3) plan my day feature where you go through the tasks of the day and either keep them or postpone them."
Super Kalender App
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it"
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub."
"I have the same recurring tasks to do every day. I need a to-do-list reminder to buzz me when it's time. The problem with this app, is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day, giving me different times the next day! That is an annoying fail! Screw it, I'm going elsewhere. if I find a better app, I'll let you guys know. UPDATE : Suggestion did not work, and I found an app, that does not drift. I have moved on."
The app is only syncing my all-day events. All other events are not displaying.
Everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake .....please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.
"Of all the check list apps I've tried out, this one is the best organized, and it's customizable without being overly complicated."
"The app is great for organizing and planning, however the constantly crashing gets old really fast. Please fix this. Otherwise the app would be perfect!"
"Not a single event, appointment, meeting, etc...is showing up. going to uninstall after rating."
Nice app. it's just I feel their is always space for improvement.
"I love everything about this app, except for how it handles snoozing repeat tasks. It's easy to use and has a lot of configuration, something a lot of other apps save for the premium version. Unfortunately, I find it unusable due to how snoozing repeat tasks then alters the date/time for all future occurrences, making it difficult to manage these tasks when I just want to snooze it this one time. If this was changed I would give 5 stars and upgrade to premium as the app is otherwise perfect."
Pretty good calendar app. I like the layout of the Samsung calendar app a little better but this one has more features.
Best app to focus and study
"It's actually good but then stopped working effectively since a week ... suddenly it stops and I couldn't open it...so, had to uninstall and install many a times, I also lost all my productivity due to it's sudden shutdown...mine is a pro version too..this is so bad and testing our patience.. please fix the issue.! Thankyou."
Love the app only had for 2 days 👍
Great app stopping me from procrastinating... Actually getting things done 👍
"The app is really good, but after some time it keeps stopping! I reinstalled it two times and the third time also, the problem persists. I was forced to uninstall it finally."
"I was going to give 4 stars, but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to Google play if you said five stars, so I lowered it to 2 stars."
"Great, but have some issues with the tasks list widget. No way I can complete a task on it without its disappearing"
Lack of personal themes. Not such pleasant view as it was in Wunderlist.
The most recent update just made it harder to move times around.
Just downloaded the app better review later on
"Updates made that are not fully tested. They need to add option to revert back to the olddd verison. that was simple to use, but most importantly it worked."
Hey i was very glad to use calendar 30 until now. I can not edit anything ... If i want to delete something is reappear every time. I can't move or delete. If is not working i want my money back. I will change the review if you solve this problem. Edit :I will edit the review after you ll solve this problem. I send it an email also.
Good.
Didn't make any sense to me. I started using this app and attempted to make a sceduale but couldn't figure it out.
"There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is."
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad
App s not opening...its vry hard to uninstal .. and instal again..plz fix tis prblm..otherwise app s too gud...
Ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
"Just I love it. I don't know this app. Once I open YouTube and see what is the best apps for student. And it tells 10 apps. But I can try only this app. So it will be very helpful, greatful, joyful and totally it suits me. It is very helpful for all. Your's, Deepika"
"I'm loving the User Interface of the app. Easy to use, simplified widget display, I don't think I even need the pro version. Perfect. Completely value adding."
"Extremely easy to use. Only thing I'm having troubles with is I have an event that I set for 15mins a week, everytime I try and tap that its comoleted it asks me to set the new rule instead of just marking complete."
No notification of Habit tracks
"Really beneficial, it allows me to follow my routines efficiently"
Lots of In-app purchases ... Not worth the time .
My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options 😊
Worst app ever!!! During the import from Wonderlist it removed all of my data. Leave it to MS to screw up a great app.
"Really pretty good app; but two problems! 1. Sometimes repeat weekly reminders don't work at all, especially if you haven't ticked it the previous week! 2. Please allow multiple reminders for one event! Thanks, it's really promising and useful otherwise!"
Good
Good for those who read offline but not for those who have online studying platform.
"NEED MORE ×.WITH APP, SO FAR SOGOOD"
"Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine."
"This application is very helpful for me. Thanks ""Any.do"" for everything to remember me."
This app is crashing again and again and again. I've pro version still it keeps crashing every 2nd day. Please fix this it's damn irritating every 2nd day to get a fresh installation.
"I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar"
"There is too much WHITE everywhere. what happened to assigning colors to folders? Add some more theme colors like purple please. The latest update added color to the calendar widget for events, can you please give us the option to choose the colors? Also please bring back the old completion sound. Lowered rating because your Android Wear app hasn't been updated since 2015. Please fix to work with 2.0. I really love this app but may have to move on if it won't work on my watch."
Lately from past two days I am facing difficulty using widget. Getting an error 'task list not found' whenever I strike off a task. Please look into it ASAP.
It allows me to leave the app. I have a Techno phone. How do i fix this? Sleeptown works perfectly though.
Probably the best productivity app available for FREE! The app itself is easy to use and it's really easy to make a task/routine. Highly recommended.
"Happy with the App...but personally I had two issues which are if addressed, may provide sort of convienience to the users. 1. If any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that I felt inconvenient to write the task again. 2. If any task is being feeded and there also undo/redo options are not available"
"Just installed this yesterday. Loved it. Love the concept. Love the design. Too bad the free version can't have access to the calendar 😝 but otherwise, it's a great app. Am gonna give it a go for another few more weeks before deciding to commit to premium."
It was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars I'm losing dates appointments
it's a nice app. it make my life displined
Good
Been using this app for for years now and I really love it and help me organize stuff/schedules.
"in primo luogo, adoro... voglio dire, una lista che mi faccia giocare ed avanzare di livello come in un rpg... non posso fare altro che adorare tanterrimo in secondo luogo: probabilmente esiste un modo per impostare orari per le attività (lezioni, cose così), altrimenti non avrebbe senso poter impostare un allarme, ma... hem... io non ho idea di come si faccia (help me please) cosa numero tre: ho provato a cercarne una versione adattabile per pc e non sembra esserci... sarebbe bellissimo se ci fosse e (magari) fosse sincronizzabile ultima cosa e poi la pianto: esiste un modo per creare traguardi composti da più traguardi? mi piacerebbe avere un megaobbiettivo laurea composto dei vari esami... o campagne composte di varie sessioni..."
"i cannt acces my account anymore since their ""password reset"" feature does not work. tried on my iphone, android oreo, web version. i don't receive any email to reset my password."
The user interfaceis not good enough. It is not that much understandable
"I like it. However, I can't seem to get the notification sounds to work. They used to."
I input my appointments and it does not ring loud enough or pop up to let me know that i have an appt.  I have the paid version.  Am i doing something wrong.  IF my appt is at 11:00 do i have to input at 12:00 to get it to ring before 11:  screwy lewy. I will change my comments and rating once i get this resolved.
The new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect
"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees."
Such a great app. Helps to organize your day perfectly. Great features
"It's good but for some reason, it keeps switching around everything. And I can't seem to move them around, so I have to delete them and start again. A bit frustrating but has a great purpose."
New update causing app to freeze. Pls correct it immediately.
I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.
I like the way this app looks. Helps me feel I'm achieving things!
"It ok, gets boring after a while"
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!"
"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am."""
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭
"A novel approach to timekeeping that totally works. Effective and elegant. The best face for my smartwatch. BUT for me personally, it is always upside-down on my wrist. Can a feature be added to allow it to be rotated 180°??"
"This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions."
I'm basically lazy. This has helped me get myself into a routine somewhat. Works like a charm. And stares right into my face everytime I open (the widget) so I don't miss a thing. Great work. 👍
"So close to being my dream todo app. It claims to support Start Times but actually doesn't. You can record the start and due time, but you can't then filter a list to only show a task that has in fact started; i.e. what can I work on NOW. For me this makes start times nothing more than a tag, that I can't interact with, which totally defeats the point."
Having trouble syncing on new device; says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong.
"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!"
좋아요
"Before this, l used Wunderlist solely for my do listn I used Workflowy for ongoing notes and events throughout the years. I ike this app, but if you don't get everything done yesterday's then My Day iwhen you wake up the next day, My Day is blank. Imagine making to do list on a posted note and the next morning it was blank? That's not saving me time. Don't know why they didn't put that in when developing the app."
"wish It would link to my calendar so I can create, edit and complete in one location....that would make it 5 stars"
Used it for 1 day. Then forgot to even open it as got into new habit. It kept showing notifications and I kept ignoring it. Not much productive for me but app design is good.
Good app but you need to pay a subscription to use it fully. There isn't an option to pay for the app outright which is a shame
Crashes at start.
Not at all use ... Its not remainding with alarming then whats is the use of remainder app... Its only alarming while we open the app... Not usefull at all
"Very easy to use, good"
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited."
Alarm nahi he
Stop looking at users as cash cows. I will be uninstalling this and moving to a different app which is as good and does not nag. This is quite a good To Do app other than that it too often comes up with prompts to upgrade to the premium subscription-based version. Since when have customers disrespectfully/greedily been treated as cash cows. It used to be apps were$5 at most for a lifetime of use but now they are greedy and arrogant enough to want $5 or thereabouts per Month! I wud pay a one off
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great
It was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
No custom repeat frequency...
Not sure.
Good experience
"Once I tweaked it for GTD, this is by far the best app out there. Speedy, snappy features and performance in every platform, extremely flexible labels, categories, projects, whatever. Easy rescheduling, adding tasks in the moment and multiple ways to do almost everything . So slick."
"It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment."
"Very good. When I find myself lost in life (very often) , I swipe my trembling thumb over to Todoist, and am instantly guided back upon the path of righteous order. My day is immediately placed upon terms in which i can fully structure and understand and from which point, seize with a newfound confidence. That, or I reschedule my tasks to the next day. 10/10 I am better for it."
"Its good. The only thing that is missing is the time inclusion. Like at what time a particular task is planned. If that can be added, it would be perfect. It would be like a personal calendar and activity planner together. I hope that can be added."
"I really like how easy it is to use, that it displays your progress in a neat and easy-to-track way, and gives you options for how to measure your success (yes/no per day, #of days per week, days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat', etc). It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend."
"Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me."
"It's ok. So this is what Wunderlist became, it's pretty similar, it's intuitive but it's lost features that made it not a suitable replacement. Specially the ability to export list which include hyperlinks in the notes (or anything in the notes) and no (official) add on for a browser like chrome. Deal breakers for me, moved to TickTick. Still miss Wunderlist :("
"Firstly, thanks for your quick responses back. I appreciate it. Ok, so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app? Because there's no tutorial for that part. When I click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there's nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created."
"When you start to reschedule things, the interface is very awkward moving times around. For example, moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive"
"I can't seem to think it so I lose my calendar after 3 months and all my appointments. Is also ridiculous amount of pop-up ads.. it would be better if forwarding dates, this could be 1 step. Sometimes it is, rarely"
"I like this app👍but my routine won't work and notifications won't make 
sounds and not appear on screen..."
The app does what it says across devices. Would love a feature to add colours to the list to sort them out as per urgency. Another feature could be to give formatting options for text for additional notes within a set task.
"App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app."
"Automatically shows the reminder Snackbar when I open other apps without me setting it up, what kind of violation is this??? Stop bugging your users unsolicitedly. Uninstalled"
Alarm doesn't work fine
"I bought the premium version of this app and it doesn't work. The reminder does not function, which basically renders the app useless. I emailed the support team and I haven't gotten any response or acknowledgement of receipt. I want a refund. What a waste of my money"
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.
After the update whenever I try o buy a new kind of tree the app closes I liked the app before but now i have losed my interest in it😒😒😒😒😒 Please fix this bug..
"Am a timetune paid user , been using for more than a month. This looks like another User Interface for just reminders. Nothing more than this . An average application"
"It seems like a good app but I haven't found a way to enable a permanent notification for quick task adding. Is it only possible? EDIT: No, I mean a permanent notification that works like your widget, allowing to quickly add new tasks without opening the app. SplenDO and Any. Do have this feature for instance."
Can't understand how it works
"Best and cleanest scheduling app I've found by far. It has it all: multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals, visually effective tags, comments visible on table and notifications, widget, statistics, events, dark theme. All without adding unnecessary noise. Using it is extremely intuitive. Doesn't lock any significant features behind premium wall, instead they're just extras that are nice to have (which is a rarity). But one thing that's missing is the ability to copy events/activities."
This is most probably the best reminder app in android. I am using it for last couple of years after trying so many apps. I just love the widgets and the ad-less experience. I use it daily to manage my work. The reminder pop up is really helpful. Thank you developers.
Very easy to use. Have all I need
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.
"Very good job. A ""postpone"" option is needed. It's a priority I believe Also, would like option for completed habits to hide for the day, and option to edit categories names, icons and colours"
I wish there would be a widget on lockscreen
Seems pretty neat but i miss one feature thst is very important for me: be able to just hit start/stop for tasks thst needs to be done for at least x minutes per day. i dont check or remember time when i start doing something.
Good but have more levels
Great app
"Very user unfriendly with hardly any explanation regarding what the buttons do or the stats mean. Trying to edit tasks for each day will only let me invent new tasks, not pick from a list. Utterly confusing. Could have been so much easier."
"Seems good so far. I might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say I didn't like it or rate it now... EDIT: to reply to the response. There was only the option to review now or say I didn't like it. I would have picked review later if that was there. EDIT 2: Thanks for taking my suggestion on board, I will update this review and rating once I have used the app more 👍"
"The new video ad is really annoying, it pops out, and no way to close it unless you close the entire app. It really interrupt when you want to add a few appointments to the calendar."
"It does the job I wanted, that is to ring alarm at the set time. However I am unable to clear the timeline! That is old ones. Couldn't get much help from their help center"
This is the best app I have seen in this whole universe it has all the features everyone should download this app 😗😗😗😗😙😙😙😙
"Can be smarter, but good."
"Great, simple app. Notifications can be better; they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless."
Does not have a recurring task feature. Useless for me.
Ads that completely take over your phone and have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them.
My calendar doesn't show up
Very happy with this calendar. Have been using it for years. Thank you.
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked
Great Tool
Simple and practical
Love it
The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.
"Very effective. I would give 5 stars ,but writting space too little. Larger writting space will help much better."
"Used to be great, ads are now far too intrusive and unprofessional"
Felt more like i was wasting time instead of getting something done.
For anyone who wants to use this app: Devs stopped updating this in 2018. So they won't reply to your queries and/or issues. Look elsewhere...
Missing an important feature!!! They need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day. It is a must for someone who has ADHD. I would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature.
"Edit (since I can't seem to respond to your comment): I have the feeling the fullscreen apps appear more often than once every 18 hours, although I admittedly am not sure about this. But the x icon only appears after a timer has run out, which is partially why they're so annoying. I do understand the need for ads, and that a lot of work is put into the app, and I appreciate all your hard work on it ;)"
Useless without pro.
That's a great app
"Authors: Please stop associating every extension with this app. It's annoying this pops up when I try to open a jar file. [Edit] This means that excluding certain very popular file extensions (svg, pdf, jpg) when a file is opened from the files app, business calendar opens. This means if I try to open a Bz2 file, a AndrOffice file (odt) or a Jar file (jar). It's strange for me that Open Office files wouldn't open in AndrOffice but instead Business calendar opens instead."
"When you use the pomo timer, it automatically starts counting down when you hit what task you want yo be working on. There is no longer an icon where you can choose your white noise before starting the pomo and no way to pause the pomo once it starts so you can select your white noise. I would like to be able to select the task I'm working on, select what white noise I want, and then start the pomo; not everything automatically start."
Easy! Make your to-do list. Check it off or move it. What else do you want in a to-do app?
"EVERY service I attempted to connect (Gmail, Gtasks, google calendar,) timed out during setup (oops error). Been 2 days and still no reply from support. Device is Samsung S9 with Android 10."
"Cool concept but an app like this requires too much focus of its own which only pulls attention away from your intended project. Maybe it would be better with a more comprehensive tutorial but I doubt it. I prefer something straightforward, like Screen Time."
This app is very helpful especially for students. I can now focus on my stuff more efficiently and with real heart.
Would pay for this if there were even more additions and updates. Absolutely love it and wish they would develop it even further
"Worst Experience Ever. I signed out, & All of my Tasks list Gone.... Login bar doesn't even showing what email it was. And I don't remember my email. I was going to buy this App, but hate now. Don't have any way to backup my list."
"Very nice, but would you consider letting people create custom categories, and setting intervals such as ""every 2 days"" instead of number of times a week? With that, this app would be perfect."
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.
A simple app that could not be more complicated to operate.
"I transferred from Wunderlist. I enjoy many features, especially being able to share it all with another person. They have fixed some of the comments I've seen like you can tell it to put a new item at the top of the list. Only problem I've seen is when I move a weekly item to a different day, it keeps the reminder on the day it was originally on."
"I love the overall concept, and, the diverse options for setup. Though, so many setting options are a little overwhelming to sort out. I've had the app for a few weeks and I am still trying tweak my layout ... visuals are everything for me. I believe, when originally setting up a few weeks ago, I was a bit annoyed to have spent time choosing colors for the widget to find out it is a premium feature (To Developer: plz be upfront on the premium feature options). I think once I get it really working for me it will be a fave app."
"There's a bug with the planning view, you can't see the title of the event. Other than that the app runs okay."
good
Love the app... But the reminder function is not working well . Otherwise app is awesome . Plz requested to fix it soon
It's not like the web site
"The app crashes quite often recently but when it works it's really useful to manage events and meetings, easy to use"
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know."
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?
"I'll like it more if I can the way I view this apps, difficult for me to type in landscape position"
Estive procurando por um aplicativo como esse.
I recently signed up and paid to upgrade to Business Calendar 2 Pro but am not sure how to activate. Need advice.
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse
"I'm disappointed, having lost my data twice because there is a serious lacuna in its program. When I delete a 'daily' item after completing it, it should go into the 'completed' list and its next scheduled occurrence immediately appear in the current list. But at times it doesn't happen like that, and if I've deleted it from the completed list even after some hours, it just disappears for ever. Seems that this action is server-dependent rather than being localized, and on the mercy of internet."
"Worked fine for months, now it doesn't track habits the way I set them. It treats every day as its own success or failure regardless of how I have set it up. Going to have to uninstall and find a new habit tracking app."
"Really great app ! Giving three star only because having problem to make routines! After adding five or six activities, it stops working. Can't add anymore ! Please notify me after fixing the issue."
Don't know how to use
"This is a great app, but i dun like it link to my calendar, because it will mess them up. Prefer if this is a standalone calendar, so that i can separate my schedule in this app, and other schedule in my calendar"
Works well and syncs well with the chosen calenders.
"After I purchased the pro version, all my previous tress were deleted. Contacted support. They told me to log out and for the past couple of days I have been unable to log back in. Unable to view friends list, sync, tags are not working properly,redeem gifts or plant trees with friends😑 the support team is also not helping me quite well. I have been emailing them and I am not getting clear instructions 👎 I am also unable to connect the intercom within the app."
Good one
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features."
Only deserve big zero. Because 1) I reinstalled this app 17 times in a week. No other app crashed this much times past 1 year in my phone. Your concept is awesome.. thats is why i installed this much times. But it needs a good developer....not just like todays...NOTE : Your 4.20.1 updation failed to solve this issue..
"I was using this app just fine without problems for about 2 months but when my wife decided to get us both a subscription, my account stopped working right. Whenever i check off a task i just get an error message and nothing gets counted. I did everything the helpers told me (clear cache, reinstall the app, restart phone) and nothing worked. Its been about a week and i have yet to hear again from technical support."
"App not starting on my Xiaomi Mi 9 SE, Miui global 11.0.6. Just a black screen. The chrome app does work (clicked on add to home screen from the website) but I really wanted to use the widget. Very disappointing"
"I really like the concept of this app, the style, the features, and it has done its part in motivating my studies and organizing my life. However, the app needs some serious redesigning. The layout is difficult to navigate and the chat function is almost useless. The way challenges are organized could also use improvement. All in all, I like using it (make an account a month ago), but the functionality needs to be improved"
"The widgets keep disappearing from my home screen Response to dev: I use both the ""BC2 - Day Pro"" and the ""BC2 - Week"" widgets and they both will disappear randomly (and at the same time, not separately). I am using Nova Launcher; I have other widgets which do not ever disappear on their own. EDIT response to dev: I'm trying with the stock launcher now, but sometimes it will take a day, sometimes a couple weeks"
"Excellent 👍 application, but I wish to add Arabic language, thank you."
"Forces you to sign up and use credentials, uninstalled."
"Tried the free version, it was useful enough to buy the paid version. It's a good calendar app."
"Great, intuitive app. Helping me with time management and productivity."
there ia no way to go back to the routine old interface? new is ugly
"Stephen, I've got to remove a star. I've been hoping you will address the issue that recurring tasks, once marked completed, don't go onto the next iteration- instead, they stay marked as completed and don't repeat as needed. I'm missing out on reminders for my daughter's medication if I don't remember to go uncheck the box after marking as complete. I know you are working hard & I want to support you, but I may have to go back to using Samsung reminders (ugh) since they don't have this issue."
"Enjoying this app in general, but notifications don't appear at the set time, and right now it just keeps popping up without prompting. But otherwise it's very good."
Fun and simple to use
"This is based on Wunderlist, which Microsoft bought a few years ago. They added some nice touches and ate listening to users' suggestions, but it is still a work in progress. They removed too much of what made Wunderlist good. It integrates well with Outlook, though. For now, it's useless for anything but the simplest task management."
I wish I could create notes without having to select a date. Otherwise so far so nice 🤓
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved."
I love how it integrated into my calendar and all the different features it offers while having a clean UI. Thanks Any.do Team!!
🖤IT
"So far so good. For premium I would like more aesthetics like color backgrounds and icons, stickers, etc. But the functionality is pleasing so far. I'm a habitual shopper for the perfect organizer app. Can't say I won't keep looking for a prettier one"
"Love this app, but it & my exchange outlook calendar stop syncing, even manually, every few days (not email, just calendar). Any ideas why?"
Unable to share to do list with another account
"I really loved Wunderlist, from the UI, to the functionality, all of it. Moving to To-Do has mostly been a disappointment and a minor frustration. I've encountered numerous bugs with the widget (which itself is very picky about where you aught to be tapping in a way I've found unintuitive) and the core menus feel clunky compared to Wunderlist. Since this is (supposedly) the same development team, I can only assume this will improve over time. It's not terrible, but it's not Wunderlist."
"This app is ok. The thing that makes it stand out for me is that I've been able to set it up to work with Google Home as my grocery and to do list. However, since the update I now can't click into the full app from the widget, which is necessary as I'm unable to rearrange my tasks from the widget and I can't seem to find a way so that the app automatically sorts my tasks by 'priority'. I can only see how to do it afterwards."
"I wanted the ability to create project, and categorized to-do lists, and this app works perfectly. I really like the home screen widget, and when I've had questions about how to use certain features (i.e. setting a recurring task) a quick Google turns up helpful results."
Doesn't sync to calendar
"todoist is the best I've found for allowing me to create to do lists and then assign tasks dates and times later, while syncing with Google calendar. Unfortunately, it has a bad habit of deleting past calandar entries, especially those that repeat -don't ever modify one instance of a recurring event!"
"İ am a business owner in Azerbaijan, so my employees are not used to using alot of technology yet. I tried using other apps but they were to complicated for my team. But Any.do is really easy to use and less complicated. We use it as personal organiser but also as a company coworking platform. Really great app that i can recommend to small and medium size businesses, but u can also use it as a personal organiser. Also it is great that this app has many different language portals"
Nice
"Fun cover, stickers and layouts."
Awful the concept is great but it is not user friendly and super annoying I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it
The Concept is quite elligant yet also hard and confusing to understand. It would be eaier if there was a calendar setting and/or addition to help the user plan along with a timeline.
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb
"Pretty good app, matches description."
Don't have a monthly plan
Not felt user friendly
Loved for a while. One fine day my subtasks got deleted. It was in a task for which i didn't set any due date. Bad experience.
To do
"A intenção é boa, mas a interface é bastante confusa. || The intention is good, but the interface is too confusing"
After the recent update displays alarms an hour earlier than they actually are. Been using the app for more than a year now and love it.
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
"Below Expectation... I purchased this app based on glowing user reviews, created an account in order to sync across my devices, however I find that if I create a habit on one device it doesn't show up on my other device. This needs to be addressed immediately."
"I really like this app. Still having problems, trying to figure out how can it work best for me."
"Regarding the last review, I noticed that multiple widgets of different lists lead to the ""emptied list"" glitch happening more often. Unrelated, but I really love the idea of the new batch action feature. Just wondering why I can't use it to batch fail or batch perform more than one task? I expected that to be the point, but only batch delete and batch skip are available. Batch fail would help with one of the biggest issues to making the app fast to use, which is that failing takes like 3+ taps"
"This app was very helpful up until the last update where they inexplicably took away the ""Lock Forest to Stay in Foreground"" feature. As of right now it's basically useless, but the support staff is great and said they were hoping to bring back the feature! So other than that it would be 5-stars. Don't change the feature that keeps people off their phones"
"Really Good App for tracking! Easy to set, access and monitor. User friendly. With this app I can control my habits. THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
"OK, it's sending hundreds of notifications with no end after an update yesterday!"
"ive downloaded all the calendar apps out there, and i like this one the most...HOWEVER, it needs to show the text on the widget not just a dot... such a bummer because i thought i found the one.. please fix this... youre so close to being the goto app for calenders for the switch off of the stock android calender... eagerly awaiting the update... 5 stars and a great review once you do it!"
I don't understand why it's not letting me type in it. It gets hanged everytime. I meant that amake ora onek birokto kortese....sorry I speak only Bahamian
Have to push too many buttons to approve my route. Not hands free friendly.
I like this app. I only used it for 5 mins and there are no adverts that ruin your experience. I hope that the developers will continue working on it so that the app will be improved. I would consider paying for the premium features too if the app is good enough.
Superb
This app certainly has some really great features which others competitiors don't. Clearly have potential to be the best in the market. Cons - Sync issues Time to load up in windows 10 Bugs in habit tracker & tasks.
"Switched to Todoist from Microsoft Todo and it has all the features from that and more. I wish that push notifications weren't a premium-only feature, as this was something Todo provided for free. Nevertheless, this is probably the best to-do list app I've used."
not so good
🥰🥰 it is a good app
"My experience with the app is fantastic, but a strange experience occurred, to me, i run parallel two emails, the one with which i presently registered offers Rs 909/ per annum subscription rate, on the contrary, with my new email it offers Rs 606 / per annuum. There is a huge difference of approximately 300 rupess. That's tantamount to cheating. Di satisfied and aghast with open cheating!!"
It'hs just too complicate to use for me
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions."
How do you get it to sync with your ms outlook calender? What does it mean you detailed it in #8
Works fine! Very handy organizational tool!
"I really like this app though I've only used it a week. I have some suggestions though, when I add a habit I'd like to add it for the week but not weekends. In Daily tasks I can + the same task more than once which is a bit like cheating, maybe add a pop up message that says ""you've already done that today"" 😊"
"App is good. But I want to suggest something > There should be To do list type of feature, that is what sort of things we are doing regularly from our routine will be selected and those which left undone will be not selected. In this way more clear picture of time allotment and productivity can be seen."
why would tasks be tabs instead of a list? the whole screen is empty and you make us scroll tabs :O
Baad
"The problem I have is that if I set a habit to be every Monday and Wednesday, for example, and I follow it successfully for a few weeks. Then if I just want to change the days, it discards all my previous progress, which is stupid. I just changed the days and the app can't understand this."
Y.
Haven't used it enough to truly rate it but it just seems like there could be some big innovation if you put more thought into it. A lot of potential if you ask me though.
"Love it, it works! I would like to have had it transfer my habits to the new phone but the backup folder didn't work. So I had to do them all over again. overall love it though."
That is really useful for me. I can use it for many plan and to do things and doing chores and ... . If U can add note (for writing notes and ...) And something like goal planner and program manager it will be more useful than now. TNX
It is ok
Theek hai
"I love the concept of habit bull, but it isn't user friendly"
"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted."
"very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock."
Exactly what I needed. A tool to remind me what to do. That's it 👌🙏❤️
"Limited use to Galaxy 7 phone: Has worked very well for me. However, please add an icon that pops up to let me know how many messages I have. Because I don't get many messages, I don't check it daily or more like others do."
"I like it! I waited purposely almost 3 weeks in order to give here a true opinion. This application is amazing because it has so many possibilities, like everything is open for you, you can set anything. This is why I recommend to whom wants to use it, to take the time to understand as it works. Read the user guide included in the app so you can set the application to your exact goal. So at the beginning it may not so clear, and maybe there are more friendly use apps, but this one in adjustable"
Extrem de utila. Recomand
"How it SHOULD work is fantastic and perfect for me. But whenever I have my schedule laid out and planned, the app deletes them or forgets them and i have to start over, only to have them deleted again. I really really want to use it. Why does it make it so unable to?"
It's good but it's often stopping and not responding I'm irritated by this..I need to uninstall and reinstall everytime and sync..no problem with my device as it is new and good company..please try to fix it. I'm a pro user.
"Not worth it. Doesn't have multiple times a day, you can't change a habit after initial setup, the interface is painful, get something better."
"Thia app has been a lifesaver. I have been able to organize all of my professional and personal tasks and am doing a better job of staying on top of things. I can write them down, schedule them and let them go until I am ready to handle them. A great new way of getting things done!"
"app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit. would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press OK. however you couldnt tap ok, it just did nothing. this happened every time. gave up and uninstalled the app. on a pixel 2 XL"
"I came back to this app a go three times over the last 2 years because I really wanted it to work. Each time I tried, I spent a couple of hours trying to navigate around the features and failed to get anything out of it. Incredibly unintuitive, no in app explanation, and the online ""getting started page"" doesn't explain much on what each features do. Edit: Thank you developer for the reply, it shows that you care. I wish you all the best in making the improvements, the idea behind the app is honestly good."
"I have used this after being forced to migrate from Wunderlist. The Android app works fairly well, but is not a solution when most of your work gets done on a computer. The web app that you end up using together with the Android app is complete garbage. It freezes on sufficiently complex to-do lists under current Chrome and Firefox versions and the developers can't be bothered to fix it. There are other open issues in the forums that never get addressed. This ends up making using the Android app for some use cases (manually reordering recurring tasks) required, as the browser tab will often freeze if you do it on the browser."
make it offline... then it will best appp
I like the app and it's a pity that I won't keep on using it because of the absence of monthly overview for dailies which I need most from a habit tracker instead of useless strikes
"Please Add ""Search"" option"
"It's a good app for scheduling your day although it's not great and have room for improvement. I do not know exactly what, as I am not an expert, but it feels that way. One thing that it should incorporate right away is the possibility of archiving Routines and Tags (not only keep or delete). I will rate 4 stars if they add this feature and 5 stars if they manage to make it a GREAT app for time scheduling."
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.
Good
A really nice application for arranging your day it's really nice and have a nice user friendly interface ❤️lots of love to Microsoft
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule
"I used this app last year and found it helpful. However, now when I downloaded it, I saw that there was a large number of bloat messages and permissions. Not finding it helpful anymore."
It's a good time planner/controller ...
"I wish I could give it 5 stars. Only thing missing is a Windows/Linux app for syncing, which I can't do without, and that's the only thing keeping me away. I would happily pay for that feature. If you just need an Android app, no need to look elsewhere. It has everything you can ask for. The UI is great, and very intuitive."
Amaizing app to manage with habits
"2 out of 3 features require premium. No, I am not going to do that."
Great Tool
"I had to pay for the option to change the colours, then I had to pay more to customise it further... exploitative money grabbing like this ensures I'll never recommend it to anyone else. Works well though"
Not bad
It sucks. My wife and I loved Wunderlist. We were synced with no problems. We have tried a million times to sync this bullshxt with no success.
"When I had an iPhone, I used the built in Reminder app relatively heavily to keep track of things I have to get done soon, remember something new to be done daily, or to break down a major side project into sub-tasks. Ever get a random idea and think ""shoot, I gotta try that"", just to forget it the next day. Put down a line item in this app. You may forget, but this app won't!!!"
Helps to motivate me to finish my assignments🌸 I wish it was like the old update for the plants though... the minutes you spend working grows different stages of the plant for the free plant. That one was more fun.
what???? too buke in here
I am not satisfied with this app because circles used for completing the habits look very dirty .
"Is it necessary to sign up account? While making a new account it's shows error ""oops try again later"""
Only events sync....would have to uninstall
"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed."
"I like this app a lot, it is refreshing but to be 5 stars I should have more flexibility in setting intervals, like selecting days of the week so I can have work and nonwork day schedules that easily repeat. When I add something to a schedule a 10min before alarm should not be default, I'm using the app to plan my day primarily. Finally each new entry should default its begin time to the last entry's end time, with the new end time shortly after, say 30 min later. That would be a 5 star app."
"I have ADHD, and struggle to manage my time and get things done. I've tried several apps but this one seems to be the best for me so far! I cant tell you why, but I have really taken to it and its helping me loads!"
"This is an overengineered list keeping app that I hate. I kept it for years in spite of that because I was in the ecosystem, but today it locked me out of my grocery list so good riddance. No i don't need it to take thirty seconds to boot up my grocery list so that your algorithm can tell me how to most productively plan my day by sorting my grocery list in order of the order I entered each item. I do not need an any.do minute."
still working on use
"Does not work, reminders do not show up."
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.
"""your favorite features are all in To Do"" - blatant lie, To Do doesn't have email notifications like Wunderlist, for example. upd 18/05/20. and now reminders left (accidentally or intended) overnight are simply disappearing, in the morning you won't see any To Do reminders! I'm really disappointed!"
I really love this free app. It's so cool to see my schedule visually and know how much time I have until the next event. The only thing I would change (and this may already be available in the paid version) is the ability to choose different colors for each event.
The idea is great but the app keeps crashing every 2 days! I need to uninstall and then reinstall it if I want it to work. Plus all of my progress is gone. Can't sign up either 👎
I can't see my trees that I've grown from the chrome extension. Please explain how the extension works.
Very intuitive interface for simple habits. Handy reminders. Does just what I need.
"If I close the app, the timer still goes on and I can use other apps. So, I end up using my phone. Kindly add a feature, so that if I close the app, the timer stops or a warning comes. Rest, it's a good app."
I'm thoroughly enjoying this app so far. I've been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies. The game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing self-made goals and gaining experience and items.
Love this app
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick."
Requesting for a dark Interface and when will the Google task integration come???
"Lots of unnecessary notifications, the GUI is confusing and is missing a few features for a habit tracking app, like splurging only every X days (but no less)."
"This is an excellent application. The interface is fresh and new, and provides a new way to look at your day. I only wish that it could be made to be resized a little larger, as well as show all day events below in a list format as they are small around the bezel. Apart from that, it is a solid 5 stars!!"
Niceee
why won't my homescreen widget display all day events? this makes it really difficult to use
Dear developer I am the paid user of application. No notification sound is coming. Please see the issue urgently.
It is a pretty good concept it's just not for me
"Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items."
Very useful. Brilliant idea and elegantly executed.
Good
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!"
"I enjoy the app and it does help me stay away from my phone, but the store keeps crashing. I cant unlock any plants, and it does get prettt frustrating when i can only plant the same two plants"
"It could be great but too hard to delete an item on your agenda. It's like you put it on your agenda and it just doesn't disappear after it's over it just keeps on repeating very annoying sad that I paid the full subscription amount thinking it would help me to stay focused with my work day, but only for a few days until it started repeating itself and I tried to find a way to cancel or delete something out of the agenda completely"
"App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!"
"Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,"
Good app was finding it useful but it's not made clear how you join the guilds or when your reg for a challenge has been ac epted no space to write diary so how do you know people actually were if there was a section for diary overall I found the app very confusing
Awesome way of focusing on activities with gamification.
No complain just amazing! But I want to see more features like to create an automated pomodoro type session where I set the planting time & break time and it will go off automatically when I start. There will be definite sessions like 30 min with 4 sessions and 5 min interval in each sessions. So I don't have to set the planting time nor break time everytime I finish planting a tree. Also it would be nice to have to do task list with planting session.
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.
"Поставил бы 5, но каждый день после 12:00 ночи, если нажать на уведомление, то из шторки исчезают все уведомления приложения, которые были назначены на конкретное время. Каждую ночь надо заново назначать время заданий, потому что они исчезают в полночь..."
Feature request: 1. undo delete or bin option 2. option to adjust snooze period (remind me tmrw mrng for eg.) 3. Option to add milestone to tasks so that it will be easy to keep track of the its progress. 4. Pls add option to change the default timings like 9am 2pm etc. 5. Also while adding a task itself please give option to 'remind me after 30 mins etc' instead of going through date and time adjustment.
Love the app and the concept BUT the app keep crashing on my phone. In a weeks time I have to reinstall it 4 times.
"Please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit, I feel like I'm cheating when I delete and re-add a whole habit because it's bugging me. Otherwise the app is a gem. 3 stars till you fix this for me. It still doesn't work, I don't want to delete a task, I want to unclick a habit, because I've accidentally clicked positive/negative and I can't undo it. Even if I click the other one to make it even, it just registers it as a separate log."
It's good but complicated a bit
The app is amazing and has the perfect layout for a list RPG . But there's a subscription you have to pay for. Literally completely ruins the purpose of the app.
bogus app. update isnt working. i was using the same app in past in the same device it was working properly. now i hv updated and its not giving any notification and even status bar is showing the past activities not current.
Nice
"The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to"
"This is the overall best app that I have found for manging the things I need to do. I have downloaded 50 of the Google play stores highest rated to-do/task planner apps and nothing has come close to TickTick. The best quality of the app is the interface. 6 months ago i paid for one year subscription of the to do planner app 'any.do' and was using that until I found TickTick. I left an app i paid for to use this - which is free but can be upgraded to premium, which I plan to do."
Its great but I need to make a habit to use the app.
"Top of my wish list is ability to copy and paste events. Other than that, great app."
Love this app. Got the pro version. It will save a lot of my cognitive work! Please fix this bug: The colour of events are set to blue when the event is created using the default colour of the (sub) calendar. Overall the app needs better UX design w.r.t the complex menu for customization and some other things e.g it was hard to figure out how to get separate widget for different calendars. But in terms of functionality it is awesome!
"It's a good app, there are many amazing functions, but there ads are very annoying"
Excellent
It wouldn't let me in
"This app is very helpful! Total game changer for my ADHD. Unfortunately, after level 25 the app becomes a money grab and the items you find and the equipment you can buy with coins get severely capped. But overall I'm happy this app exists, it really helps me stay on track :) Perhaps if the game cost a few dollars to purchase the developers wouldn't need to resort to capping in order to create revenue from the app. I feel as though many people will quit once the RPG element is restricted."
i love it but my daily tasks dont reset at midnight so i cant use it in the morning im in western canada what timezones should i set this to so it works for me? irs just frustrating not being able to use it for the majority of my day
Easy to use. Has everything I want from a habit tracker. Great app. I use it every day.
"Absolutely terrible. Most unless app I have downloaded, to date."
I don't think that hazel-E abuse beaten pouring bleach blowtorch into lakeisha
"So far so good. I decided to buy it almost immediately. It is exactly what suit my needs. App is quite flexible despite not too much settings available. I only wish two things more in the future. One: to make tasks which are done to be crossed out or make them disappear, especially on the widget, because right now if you have many tasks there is quite chaos on the screen and it is difficult to recognize things, Second: just for fun... make possible to get some sound when you mark task done:)"
I liked it but most of intresting features was unable until you purchase them.
"This is such a fun way for chores to be rewarded. My household is full of gamers, and this is a great way to create and maintain habits, as well as track chores on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis. They are great about getting back to users. They have real conversations, and listen to user feedback."
This app deleted my whole google calender
Useless and time consuming. Got pro version but no option for refund
Good but notifications are not working
Good app. Have tried a few of the others. I continue to stay with this one for its featured.
"It does everything that my old task app used to do (wunderlist) but has some additional functionality which annoys me. There's a ""My day"" page which, I like as a concept, but it doesn't link to the tasks I've planned for ""today"". If I want today's tasks to appear there, I have to open the task and add it to ""my day"" which seems like a waste of time. I'd ignore that functionality entirely but it's the very first item on the app menu and it just annoys me being there not reflecting my actual day."
cant use if i dont allow permission for contacts? dumb
"Decent app, but not worthy of monthly fees. What happened to 1x Pro licenses?"
Good idea but glitches...eg I incorrectly logged a day as performing a habit and could not change the fact I had actually broken the chain...
"Good app and so close to what i was looking for, but it's missing one thing. If you could add an option to add your own tasks WITHOUT it having to be an actual event that'd be awesome. I don't want to add ""wake up"" or ""gym"" as an event in my calendar."
Free version too much limited.
"Well I saw a lot of people using this app, and base on they're ratings they say it's good but for me It's not, the app constantly crashes if I click some buttons inside the apps, It always crashes whenever I try or need to use it, Please fix it I really want to use this :<"
Very useful app. But the widget is not showing my to do list. I have resize then they will appear and again after some time they get disappear
Kinda complicated. Still not used to it. I love the widgets though.
Please help. Relogging in after several months disuse. It has asked me to enter a username and it's stuck on 'username taken'. Will not let me progress to the app. I've tried every random letter/number combination so it's definitely not taken. Just buggy app?
I have ever seen the app which ask for watch a video to delete past record..... uninstalled Information theif.
Alarm doesn't work fine
Stupid decision to remove timer.
Ughhh gosh jus get on wid these reviews...wut yuck is this 😬😬😬👌👌👌
"Some pretty basic standard features in other apps are missing. The options menu is very limited with no option to default a tasks due date, project, category etc. These have to be entered every single time a task is created which makes adding quick tasks on the fly very annoyingly slower than other apps. There is no sorting options or filters on views (ability to create custom views does not exempt this feature from being useful). Too many clicks to edit tasks, eg notes/comments, rescheduling."
Was really enjoying the app but now the widgets stopped working.
"Just lowered my rating. Used to work great but now does not properly sync everything in my task list with my Google Calendar on my computer. It will sync new events & new tasks. But if I edit a task (ex. change the date of the task), it does not sync properly w/ my Google Calendar. It used to be that all edits synced & appeared the same in both the app & my Google Calendar, but not now. I have been emailing with the support for this app, but have not yet found a solution."
"Why do you have to make a microsoft account just to use a to-do list? After which it stays at a loading screen indefinitely. Yup, great app guys. Truly setting the bar high for these other apps..."
"I thought I'd like it. I like it more than I thought I would. Seeing appointments and meetings on a clock face is extremely intuitive, and having a widget that can show it on the home screen is a real boon. Fully recommended."
"Love the app, but there is a bug in the current version of the app where ""next week"" actually schedules things for two weeks out. Actually scheduling in general in the app seems a little wonky. These are new issues as of a few weeks ago. Otherwise it would be 5 stars."
This app is very useful for students and other works
very useful. its where I note my accomplishments for the day as well as my planned tasks/events.. thanks to the developer of this app..
"It took 3 tries to get registered, now it wont let me change anything in character creation. I didnt even make it to setting up anything beyond skin tone before it wouldn't let me select anything. Awesome idea, crappy execution. Womp womp."
"Whole other to do list apps provide muce more for a normal user for free, you are just greedy minded pushing everything to be paid."
Dont this app have repeat task feature?
cool idea. woupd be good if it could access my outlook calendar
"Good home management app. My husband and I share a few different lists, like shopping, tasks, movies, etc, and it works for us. It's not a 5 stars because when I tried to use it as a personal daily task list, I wasn't all that satisfied. I would expect uncompleted ""day tasks"" to remain visible for the next day, or recurring weekly items which you completed this week, to disappear from your to-do list until the following recurrence."
I've been using this calendar including the first version for years. It works well with Google Calendar. I also drop the link in for my son's soccer schedule. Every time I upgrade my phone I try their calendar to compare. No comparison. I prefer this app.
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved."
"Following daily routine has kind of become cool since I've downloaded this app, it's THAT good. No complications, gives you exactly what you want and more with the colour and tag image options. And I am talking about the Free version here. Will buy the premium in future."
"Have only used the app a little while, not to bad for basic tasks. To bad you can't do lots of tasks unless you buy the premium version. It's an easy app to use"
"I'm using the free version and its a disapontiment. No themes, you can't delete default lists. It's ugly."
"A multitude of options available to style your own planner/to-do list. Give it a try, and I'll bet you like it!"
Excellent app! I should've switched task apps a long time ago. This app has all the features of my old one (gtasks) and more in the free version. I love the colors for the lists. I love the repeating task option - this is critical for me. Thank you! I may donate to an app for the first time for this app!
Changing from wunderlist I was concerned it wouldn't be as good. I'm increasingly appreciating this app. Seems big improvements were made to it to reflect some of wunderlist best features. Thanks for the work put in to achieve this.
"The app is really useful, one must download it but it just have one problem that we need to refresh the widget all the time to see current time, unless we don't refresh the widget we cannot check the upcoming event through widget, if you can solve this, this is one of the best app for daily use and surely you'll get more pro version users of this app. Thank you."
"Overall i like this app, but i use it to make appointments, and it is very annoying that it won't link the name with the phone number frim the contacts automatically. You can do it manually, but it would be way quicker if it would link it automatically."
I like this app so much . It make me stay Productive. I wish it had a pause button too... but it made me focus in my studies. As a student I would like to recommend this app to you guys
I haven't found the way to edit the days of the week for one habit.
Crashing
"I have stumbled on this app just now and downloaded it immediately and found that its reminder alarm is uniquely user friendly. In tha past I used Any do and Tick Tock, but none has an alarm that works like this app. It even has a snooze button. No doubt that my efficiency will go up by leaps and bounds. I have also just now subscribed for its cloud feature . But found the charges to be too high.. I request the developer to rithink and reduce the charges and also to introduce a one time payment."
"The only thing is I thought it would love completed tasks to the end, but I can't seem to find that function anymore. It's fine, but sometimes I use to like to l back on the stuff I accomplished in a day or make sure what day something got done. No big deal."
"Uhmm...hello creator... I just want to ask when I opened the app, it glitches and it will turn back to my home. Please fix this thank you"
I'm having lots of fun. I feel motivated to do more in the day. So far I have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need. I just hope it will work for me long term!
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.
"Better than To Do, love the calendar function I could do without the frills and animations, though"
This app is fairly effective at gamifying my approach to staying focused. They have also taken care with features to make my user experience smooth and return control to me. I went ahead and purchased for some of the additional features because the price was very reasonable for the continued work they are putting in. One thing I think would be great if they could keep it as minimal and simple as the rest of the app is to let me customize self tracking that I have to do with the tagging.
"I had been using a notepad app, but you had to backspace each item as you went along. With this app, I just click the item as it is done and it marks the item as complete. With one tap, I can remove all completed tasks at once! Plus, I have everything in one place! I highly recommend!"
Lost the ability to show overdue tasks along with other open tasks in planned and tasks tab. Need this back as this is a reminder of what hasn't been done. Not much use if have to go to a separate tab to find them.
Update: June 2020: do not use this app free version. It recently started forcing full screen ads that lock your screen for the duration of the ad. Original review from 2018: Great app! Very customizable and the ads are small and non-intrusive. I've been using it for years and had only 1 issue that was resolved after contacting customer support.
"I regret buying this app. (TL;DR: don't use this app if you ever intend on changing routines or planning.) Changing existing routines is very hard as it simply deletes whatever overlaps in time. So unnecessary and impossible to revert. If you accidentally click PM instead of AM once, your whole day is deleted permanently. Also, every time I want to sync between my phone and my tablet I have to export it to Google Drive and then import it from the other device. Also, you can't copy items or days to another time. Please make this app more user friendly!"
awesome
"Doesnt work on ALL android Wear OS devices. Specifically, doesnt work with the Watch Active2."
I paid for the premium app and still get mashed to do a review
Asks for a subscription to get all the features. I'd pay a one time fee only. Guess you don't want my money bad enough. Edit: yes I know which is why you got a negative review. I like your app. I don't like paying subs. I raised u to 3 stars for taking this so we'll. All to often devs get all butt hurt. Add a feature to buy a lifetime license even if it's 20 dollars and I'll buy it. Or give us an option to see ads without a sub at least. Cheers. Do this than 5 stars.
"Great app. I am trying to find an application like this one for a while. If you are looking for an app that will help you grow, this is the one for you. You have multiple skills to choose from. Also, you can create your own. I love that they had programming, and an Icon of Python to choose. To get the full features you need to purchase the application. However, you don't need to buy or watch annoying adds to use the application"
"Please also add the option to import few activities from any day instead of the whole day onto timeLine of a routine. Further please add the feature of allowing a to start a routine custom routine Using time interval instead of defining exact time, because on some bad days due to unavoidable circumstances we are out of schedule and adding a fresh custom timetable for the day hurts a lot modifying Timings for every activity. For rest of its features it worth 5*****."
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.
"It's cute, but the fact that I cannot view a calendar with my progress kills it for me. I am going to stick to Loop app."
"Nice app... Good layout and design.. One request- Add tracking as well to the tasks.. then it will be complete solution Along with setting up tasks I need to track as well which tasks I have done today, weekwise and monthwise"
"Is there a residual value of the service? For example if you take subscription for Evernote, it lets you catalogue your stuff and files that has future use. There is no residual value of reminder once the task is done. Do I need to pay $36 just to get a reminder? All that is needed is just one challanger app. Meanwhile there are loads of other good apps. Using tick tick as a compromise for the time being !"
"I really like the concept, but the app/widget doesn't recognise 'reminders', only 'events'. If my day was organised hour by hour with events then this would be ideal, but I rarely have more than 2 events per half day. Reminders I use all the time, if the widget recognised those then it would be far more useful to me. Would still recommend despite this."
"Do I get a premium for free, if I report a bug😅. Edited :- I was just messing with you😅. I am an android developer myself and I know how hard it is to maintain something like this. Steps to reproduce the bug. Step 1 : Fresh install the app (No data in the app) Step 2 : Press and drag hamburger icon upward. Toolbar will go upside and you will not be able to drag it back again. But you can use the navigation drawer by dragging from left to right."
Not a fan. I paid for the upgrade and it isn't working out for me. Maybe others will like it but I don't.
"Nice but please give option to add different time intervals for habits. For example I want to develop habit of drinking water and want the reminder to come at multiple particular times a day. The app allows only one specific time for the reminder, so please add the mentioned feature."
My suggestion to Microsoft is this. Add some statistics in the app. That will give information about the completion rate of the task. A graph will help.
"does not work properly , does not update wit hcalendar entries , worst thing , cannot aak my money back!!!!!!!"
So nice daily routine app
Inaccurate - always says activity overlaps with another activity when it doesn't.
I do not use it so I want to cancel the subscription but am unable. Jorte had unsubscribe within opening page. Unable to sign in.
"I love this app! I can no longer install it on my WearOS watch. The app says ""installing"" on the WearOS play store, but never completes. Please fix this!"
"definetly a 4 star. good app, good concepts some bugs, not really pulling me in thou. i forgot about it, which was sort of the point of the app to make me not forget it. so 4 stars."
I am not able to use application in my mobile phone.
"Repeats tick now...however I encountered another problem. There's no way to restore ""purchases"". Meaning if you subscribe and than reset/wipe the app or your phone, you can't use the subscription features anymore. And to get it back you have to completely resubscribe."
"Widget has been broken with the latest update, keeps reverting back to the My Day view and then once it does that the button at the top left doesn't work anymore and so can't be switched to show other lists without removing the widget and recreating it, please fix!"
Foes the same job as wunderlist but functions better.
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff
Excellent
Very cool app for keeping track of your tasks and schedule
"I try to set tasks for only specific days of the week, but it does Not work. After I complete the task that's it. It's done forever, doesn't repeat. Since most of my tasks need this feature to work...the app really isn't good for me."
I like it it's very reorganizing
"For 2.6.1: TimeTune background task error keep persists due to: screen is off, battery saver, powered off. You can also add new features: ""Refresh Background Tasks when accessing app"" toggle switch, it refreshes everytime when they accessing the app even background tasks blocked by system"
"Can't add an Outlook calendar that isn't on MS Exchange, so that means you can't add any regular personal Outlook calendar. That's pretty bad. EDIT: The developer response links to a page discussing MS Exchange-enabled Outlook accounts. My comment was regarding non-Exchange accounts. So the developer didn't even read my review properly."
"Great app. However, I was not able to sync with Google calendar and it was a deal-breaker for me. Uninstalling..."
The app was awesome but it stopped working in a week. I'm not able to add any routine now.
"overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much. I suggest adding swiping options to the task (look at nine email as an example). but overall good. might return one day :)"
"This tool really helps me see my progress so that I can feel motivated to change. When I see that I have been on a successful streak, it helps me believe that I can make positive changes for real and forever. I only did four stars because if you want to track more than 5 things you have to pay. Also, their forums seem to only feature drug and sex addicts. It's kind of creepy really...but you aren't required to participate...so I ignore it."
"Lots of good features, but this morning for the 2nd time this week, all the tasks have disappeared. Last time I had to uninstall and reinstall it to have the tasks resynch. Needless to say, this is quite annoying"
"Update - Merging two tasks vanished both of them. Tried again, same result. Great App. Recommend/ Request : In Location reminders, couldn't find a way to switch the map 🗺 to Satellite 🛰 view. If it's absent, kindly add it as it is very essential to mark most locations. If I missed it, kindly 👉 me."
"I personally would like to add to this app, if I had a chance is change how the entires were set up. You had to make up the name. But it would make it better if it had a date and name. To me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper. Add more cool features that you can't find anywhere else."
Good app for task but should be linked with reminders.
"I'm trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good. The only feature I'd really like is to share reminders - is that possible? E.g. if I set a task in a shared list, I'd like everyone to receive a reminder for that task (or at least the person who has been assigned). As it stands, you can only set up reminders for yourself."
Will update down the road
"This app has been so helpful for me to be more productive, as i didnt take care kf myself before! i can't complain about anything, except sometimes when i first log in for the day, my dailies will be from yesterday and will take a minute to switch to today. I would love to see why so-and-so points are being deducted when you take damage from missed dailies! Like.... ""Clean (medium): -6 Health"" or something like that. I don't think I'll ever delete this app, and i look forward to any updates!"
"i think the app is satisfaying my will. but the pro version keeps a non-ecard user not happy, so im giving you 3/5 bcuz of this."
Unable to turn on deep focus mode.
It's great. I love it.
"I'm enjoying the app so far. The only pain point is when editing a list item. I'm using a mobile device and it's difficult to drop the cursor at the front without accidentally checking the item off. A little more space between the writing and the check circle might eliminate this problem. It also struggled to upload a photo to a list item. An error message came up instead. Otherwise, so far so good."
Worst ap
"Stuck on setting the user name, no error message etc. Used to be good"
It seems like a good app with good features but it's not intuitive at all. I spent fifteen minutes trying to find a way to skip a repeating task this week and I could mark it done. I try deleting to see if it would delete just that occurrences but it deleted the whole thing. The icons are also not intuitive at all.
Easy to work out the app
Does not show dates of bookings as it used to detect from emails
Very helpful for a forgetful brain like mine really helps me to keep appointments and get stuff done 👍😁 u did a great job on the app
Good.
"Best time planning app I've used! I struggle to keep tasks in order and know how much of my time they will take up. This app has all the features I need, and while I've only used it for a week, it has definitely increased my productivity. 10/10 I recommend to everyone."
"So disappointing!!! I used to love this app bit over the last few months it is Sooooooo glitchy! I just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime I think Im done, they show back up in triplicate!! Everything I changed IS STILL THERE AFTER AN HOUR!!! DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD TIME MANAGEMENT PROGRAM????? AND NO WAY TO CONTACT SUPPORT BECAUSE WHEN I TRY TO GET TO THE MENU IT SHOWS A BLACK SCREEN!!!!!"
Required me to sign in to use it? Pass.
"I'm sure the app is great seeing all the positive reviews not had earned. But having dark mode being ba premium feature is a deal breaker for me, because I would like to extensively test a product before considering a premium subscription but I can't get to use an app that forces light mode why all of my other apps are dark"
Le mode alarme ne fonctionne pas bien
Perfect app for phd student who has smart phone and need focus in his/her studies.
"The game is very buggy, I just bought a reward, then the app crashed, and the gold I've spent is gone, but I didn't receive the reward. These kind of experiences unfortunately decrease the gaming fun tremendously, and it could be such a good game otherwise!"
"It's okay application however it is not that practical. Reason is more 
often than not I have some event I'd like to add and shift around my 
routine. This is not possible at the moment (using programmer for 2 out of 
3 days is meticulous just so I can add 1 event). It would be good to have 
the ability to move and split routine items with events. In essence make 
programmer less of a hustle, and more natural and quick to use."
"Love the interface and how easy and helpful it would be, but the alarms I set do not not ring. I gave permissions to this app already, yet it doesn't. Edit: Thank you for letting me know it's a Huawei power saving issue! Are there any work-arounds the power saving mode on Huawei to still allow this app to run? The alarms are very important, without them the app is critically impaired on my device. Haha. Thanks!"
Crashing a lot after update
"The whole app is pretty broke on the note 9 (edit: I would love to report the big to help however, the settings menue does not work so I do not have the ability to send a report)."
"This app is very, very, very sexist. When you start the app up and go into the ""icon"" menu for the avatar of your ""hero"" character, the vast majority of the icons possibile to select are definitively male.   Worse yet is that all of the ones 'intresting' in thier design - or portray something such as the workplace are entirely male.  The few female icons avalible - more than half not even on their own- are showing an entirely narrow view with a subservient feeling in thier portrayal.   The developers of this app should be ashamed of such blatant misogyny."
This app look cool on the screen but it was hard to figure out how to use it the could be more settings added to the app so people can make it more direct for their life.
Already helped a lot. Wish it had more colors.
"it's fine to use to check off stuff and gain/lose habits and get rewarded for it, but the formatting is so ugly and it's so easy to cheat which kinda defeats the purpose of the app. like you can make yourself level 100 or give yourself 2,000 gold if you want to. plus there's a lot of bugs even though habitica has been alive since either 2015 or 2014 so that kinda says it all for how much the staff is on things."
"Great app 😊👍 love it. Even sends me notifictaions to remind me to mark this day. Also general descussion is a good idea, its very incoraging to see other people on the app strrugling keeping habit of stuff, just makes you feel like you're not alone 👍"
"If Google Calendar integration was available with this app, it'd be loads better. Apart from that it's great. I've been using it for a while alongside other apps like Anydo and Todoist. They have a few features that I hope Microsoft builds into this app, but on the whole, I like this the most. It's simple, you can export your lists, and you can create steps for tasks."
Great
"Used to love it, but the latest version broke it. Couldn't get it to work. All widget face buttons would work for a few seconds then break. Tried all settings, didn't work. Fix it and I'll reconsider my rating."
"I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone..."
Perfect!
"By far and away the best of all the dozens of task manager apps I've tried using! So intuitive. Can't wait for the ""upcoming"" feature that's on the way. But gotta thumbs-down the new widget. No way to open the app straight from the widget so I removed the widget from my home screen all together."
"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off"
I love the layout and different features. Two things that I would love changed or added are: 1. The ability to either edit a routine for a singular day or to clear a routine from a singular day (like when I have an atypical day and can't follow my regular routine); and 2. The ability to see the overlap in events/routines if two different things occur at the same time.
👍🏻
"Best calendar app for Android I've found by far. It would be nice it there was a version for windows as well but as it all syncs nicely with Google it's not a problem, just a "" would be nice to have"""
There is some sort of issue which I guess the app developers are dealing with already that the application crashes immediately after opening kindly release the update to fix this flaw quickly. The app deserves 5 stars
I wanted a to do list.. this is not such.. continually asking to name things unnecessarily complicated ~ KISS
I haven't been using this very long and it's not as user friendly as the Calender that came on my last phone.  I wish instead of dots you can just see what you have entered for that day immediately without tapping on that day.  Otherwise it is easy to use and functional.
Great creative idea that does help keep me on track. I've also used it to start new good habits!
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle
"Great app which has everything I need! It's not very easy at first, but the result it gives is worth the effort. I like that you can see your characteristics in a diagram and how customizable everything is. Thank you!"
Great app
"Everything is good, except it crashes every 2 days and I have to reinstall it"
Works great. I enjoy having it available on my phone and on my work computer.
"I've been using the app since 2018, TickTick has been the number 1 app for me, I definately reccomend it 👏👍💯"
I have just started using this app and it looks great - except for the drop down menu from the 3 dots which doesn't show the full menu and you cannot scroll down in it either. PLEASE FIX THIS!!
Use it all the time. Its my Diary
$36 per year for push notification reminders? No thanks.
"Can't sync anymore, and all my lists are gone after I relogged (no lists when I log in through the browser either). Tried ""Get help"" but no reply for several days now."
"Better than others but I have problem in the beginning, I'll let you know later..."
"Did not enjoy the layout, workflows, rewards, explanations. A+ for the effort."
App is great....but it gets closed automatically before a session ends and my plant gets ruined..
I'm still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot. One would not waste time if they have this app in hand.
"Great concept, unfortunately sometimes a bit buggy implementation: really weird back stack handling and syncs don't work quite often. Staying with it for now hoping on things to be fixed in the future."
"It is awesome app..but if it would contain the 'PAUSE' button..it would be more meaningful, as when one need to attend something in between the activity..he can't give up the tree. Moreover it leads to false analysis of focussed hours."
"It's a great app for staying away from the phone while attending to one's tasks. As not all tasks are born equal, I'd really like to see taller trees for longer focus periods. It would be rewarding, plus the forest would look nicer and unique based on one's day"
Great product
"Absolutely love this app. 4 out of 5 for two reasons. One, navigation, I think swiping between habits rather than scrolling would be a better interphase and also more intuitive. Scrolling habits only goes one direction, swiping could go both, as long as you're off the calendar. Two, the free version only can track five habits. I'll probably buy the app for full access, because this truly is a good app. However just a few more, say 10 instead of 5 in the free version would've been appreciated."
"This is a wonderful app, I love the simplicity and intuitiveness - it helps me reduce stress from the many things I need to do and instead allows me to focus and get more things done overall!"
"I had opted for premium. But even basic things like I wanted to start fresh, so I said delete all tasks, but it added that as a reminder from what's app."
a little shy on functionality but for the price it can't be beat. I use it daily.
Can we please have sub tasks Placed under our main task… ? The analytics are not so useful to be honest..
Why it doesn't open in my android. It really sucks. Please do something.
"I miss the Today, Week & All shortcuts that Wunderlist had at the top. The Planned replacement is not as easy to view or follow my week ahead at a glance. The automated transfer seems to have worked well so far. UPDATE: Sharing lists previously shared with my wife now creates a double so that needs to be fixed ASAP. Wunderlist would randomly delete scheduled reminders in bulk, hopefully To Do has put a stop to that."
"Its a bit hard to use at first but if you adjust yourself , you'll get the hang of it"
"Suddenly, again (it has happened before), the widget is empty. I keep refreshing, but the entries vanish."
"JULY 2, 2020. Same problem. WORKS FOR THE FIRST TIME I OPEN IT, FOR THE NEXT ONES IT JUST IMMEDIATELY CLOSES ITSELF 6.20.2020 I can't open it. The app won't work. I have to reinstall it everytime I want to plant again."
"This product has really come a long way since I tried it in 2019. Best Android task mgr app with really clean interface and great widgets. Syncs almost immediately with web and Windows apps. Windows app includes multiple drop down widgets so you can view / edit tasks anywhere within Windows. Support has improved substantially and is generally responsive. For solo users, TickTick beats all the higher priced apps hands down. Have not tried it for teams, but it's really targeted for solo users."
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer."
"when opening a sub-task from any view, the sub-task window does not even show the main list/task it is from"
superb 👌 👌👌👌👌
Best habbit app
"doesn't do what I need it to do with setting recurring alarms, such as every 3 hours forever. it just says ""how many times"" do you want this to repeat but doesn't let you choose hourly. Just daily, weekly, etc."
"I liked its features. These are well thought through. If I could go back in 
timeline, it would have been better."
"Hello, I recently shifted to a new phone. I have a premium membership. But I am unable to transfer my data to the new phone. Please help!"
"As great as this app is there is no way to turn off the annoying popups within it. 'rate us', 'congrats 10 days in a row' really? I can see the result. Please add an option to turn off all popups within the app."
"The app is really great and don't even need the paid version. Unlike what people said, I found it quite easy to set up. I wish the ""custom repeat"" had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days, as my schedule varies (schema as : 4 days A followed by 3 days B). I really love the widget option also. I just downloaded it but if I keep using it then I will consider buying the pro version to support the creators."
"I was using it and thought it was pretty good.I had my whole business schedule on it, then I lost my phone. I got a new phone and downloaded the app again, logged on and no schedule! It was gone! I lost thousands of dollars and had many clients pissed off at me... So disappointed..."
don't bother with this planner app. there are lots of other apps that do the same thing. this app has intrusive ads thats pop up at random. if you close the app and open a different app planner pro will open a pop up on the new app your using. seriously don't even bother with this BS
One Problem With This App Is It Stops And Also Notification Also Hide And Ask For Refresh And Troubleshooting Then It Again Start Show Every Time I Have To Open The App And Refresh Then It Start Working This Must Be Solve
Love this app. I used to give it 5 stars but its so sliggish on the s8 and half the time the widget wont load.
"Sends lots of emails, you can't choose a duration for your tasks it's only limited to a day . It's good if you like to be bombarded by emails for a task that you totally know it's not over due , also the user experience is too complicated"
"Laggiest experience ever, icons were missing everywhere, it seemed really cool but quite unplayable for me."
"I would love to do a one/life time purchase for this app. Too bad I hate subscription based so sorry, I'd rather spend my money for something unproductive than this app."
"I have autism and downloaded this app to help mange my tasks and routine, but after trying to work it out for 10 to 20 minutes, I've decided it's not for me. I couldn't set a very simple habit of brushing my teeth twice a day, or a reminder to stretch twice a week on certain days of the week. Not as straight forward to use or set up as it seemed."
The integration with the calendar and options to enhance the entry is excessively useful. It helps to keep track of multiple issues without having to use a complex Gannt chart or spreadsheet.
worste app ever
"only been using for 3 days, easy to use"
The app always crash. I already sent a report both to your email and through the app (which I have re-downloaded many times) but still with no reply. I'm using the pro version. It is annoying that I have to re-download it every time I need to use it.
"Love this app. I use it to keep track of ongoing, long term projects. But you can use it for day to day task (to do list) management Very easy to learn your way around the app and get started quickly. Highly recommended."
"Great app. Just bought Platinum. My only issue is when setting my goal for a habit. Let's say I have a habit named '1 hour of study'. And I set my goal to doing this 5 times a day. Even if I would only do it twice (meaning 2 hours) each day the app would show it as a streak, even though I haven't reached my actual goal during any of the days. So it does see it as a success even though it wasn't for me. Could you maybe implement an option to make it possible to show those as unsuccessful?"
"upon using the app so far, i wish that it would be accessible offline. other than that, the idea to challenge yourself to earn points for your habits and chores is quite remarkable"
"App is good but have some bugs.....Notification changes automatically to 
default after some time"
All the things that it advertises that it does you have to pay for disappointed
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving."
Love the functionality and the customizability! I used the watchface all the time on my wearOS watch. Only thing I wish for is the ability to use it on my new Samsung watch. Would pay alot for that feauture
Useful app
"Paywall, even for dark theme. Very disappointed"
"There is a bug: I set the widget to 70% transparent black, but after every reboot, the widget's appearance returns to the default preset."
"Hi. I love the app. There's a bug that I want to share. I created a daily task (once a day) but it doesn't go away after completing it from ""Today's"" task. What do I do? Thank you"
Tried to share a list with my husband but it won't share between my Office account and his Personal account. It's a show stopper.
"I have only been using this app for about six days, however I'm really enjoying it. I like that you can mess with the color scheme and the encouraging quotes. It's also affordable if you are more than five habits. One thing I think that would be absolutely amazing to have on here is a spot for goals and some kind of daily journal write. Aside from that I love it so. 🤗🤗 If it had a spot for journal writings and goals it would definitely be five ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐"
"I think that this app is honestly really fun!! and for an unmotivated student like me, this gives me more motivation to study but this app has limited rewards and it takes very long to get enough coins to buy new trees so the forest becomes boring after awhile. I recommend giving new trees as rewards after focusing for eg : 200 mins 3 days straight or something like that. this app also deleted my 2 hour study because I used my phone during the last 1 minute to check on texts from my teacher 😭😡"
confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks. just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks.
Glad my dad found this. BEST EVER. this is just amazing. You can do so many things. I am premium and boy i tell you its the best thing ever. From customizing you task to ticking of the task. This is a must have for every type of person and every age. Recomended app.
"I never give reviews. I believe in if you don't have anything nice to say, don't say it. My issue is not with the app itself, its the fact that I have been charge every single month for over a year! I have reached out to the developer many times and nothing. There is NO subscription for me to cancel...I am really over it with this!!!"
Very helpful app. Well organize. No problems. Highly recommended..
"2nd Edited review: The app is worst for reminders since it takes many minutes to fire. Which simply means, the app is worthless. Now the customer service told me that I'm using a cheap device, when in fact it i m using a premium budget phone. Bulls**t customer service as well since they clearly can't take the blame like a real man/woman. Bunch of frauds n scammers tryna make their customer buy their failed invention. Go fu*k urself customer service! Good luck selling nud*s coz u failed it here!"
"Everything is three colors: black, white, and bg color. Nothing feels separate or distinct, meaning I find it hard to visually separate individual tasks. To do lists should help me break down tasks not make them feel like a uniform lump. The star shouldn't be the same color as the background if it's supposed to stand out. Please make the star stand out more with a banner like Wunderlist and with a different color."
Please create desktop app
"The app itself is great, it syncs with the echo to get your tasks... Without an audible reminder of tasks though it's not really any use and to get reminders is 3 quid a month."
"When I goto monthly view press the date the event is on, the previous date shows up. Sometimes I am able to scroll forward to the date I am looking for,but mostly not. ( for example I scroll April 24th and April 23rd shows up). I like the design of the app,would like to see yearly view. I also can't see Events I posted unless I rotate the phone. But it works for tasks and notes tabs fine?"
"Lost my custom lists and tasks after the current app update... Like the app otherwise but if it wipes your info, then whats the point? Update: was still there online, signed out of the app and back in. Its all there now!"
It is ok but maby it could be a bit more clear
Very simple and easy to use.
"Everything is good, except it crashes every 2 days and I have to reinstall it"
"Tick Tick is great. My daughter recommended it to me. She likes the natural language option. I love the option to create habits out of recurring to do tasks, that's important for me, as I'm using Tick Tick in part to try to put my life back together after my husband's death. It's very helpful to have a checklist and form habits that are little in the moment but cumulatively make a big difference. Still trying to figure out how to not have a date for a list item though (for book/grocery lists)."
It's not a good app I don't recommend it everything you have to pay for .
Good app and prompt support.
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks"
Perfect app but you need to add night mode
So far I like it I thought there would be an option to sync your routine from the Google calendar but apparently you can only sync the timeline. The time tune staff has been very helpful and the app has alot of potential!
Really well developed system which is fun/easy to use. Since the good functions aren't blocked by premium necessities it makes this app a well worth download. Adding a schedule would however benifit as it would allow the users to keep everything on the app itself.
"When you put something in a category and then rename it, you have to re-categorise. Not amazing at sharing - list items get out of sync on multiple devices."
Fantastic app which helps to keep me organised. I have used it for over three years now. Keep up the good work.
"Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People"
"Couldn't edit any habit in this apps can't add pages, episodes, and liters bec they're not available in the edit menu.. The only way to edit a habit is to delete it."
"और इम्प्रूवमेंट चाहिए, हमारे सवाल व्हाट्स एप्प में लेवे"
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭
This app is so good for focus on your study .👍
Please can you integrate with Outlook calendar
"Great app! Intuitive navigation, easy to use. Nice integration with other apps. What's up with the lavender color designation?! I didn't think that lavender would look turquoise."
fun and easy
Good enaught
"It's so useful! My husband and I can collaborate on the grocery list, household to-do's, baby name ideas and more! Minus one star for the less than intuitive way of deleting items and lists, and it would be neat to be able to have subcategories within lists (i.e. separating the grocery list by department)."
It is completely failing on reminders!
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.
can't open
The problem is that it doesn't alarm... why.. But it is useful
"Be careful with this app. They will give free trail for few days and collect your card details. They will deduct the amount after trail period without informing you. I am struggling now, how to invoke the amount."
"All features of this app is good, as it is the same like wunderlist, however request you to add sorting as per assigne feature , which wunderlist has but missing in microsoft to list"
Poor update .... it calculates time wrongly N it reduced my coins from 533 to 510 for no reason .... earlier i really liked the app but now i dont
"I have such extensive ideas for productivity apps that a developer should retain me as a consultant before the competition gets me. None are even close to my standards, yet. One general idea for free: if a customization option that any one to-do list app has is useful, why don't they all have it?"
I don't like the layout at all. I want it to be much more simple and quick to edit my daily tasks.
"It's a good app ,it has everything which a study app require or more...but only it doesn't have ranking system...."
It was decent but I remember having to tap so many times just to get it to record your progress. Not very streamlined.
I don't know if a Google update has rendered this app useless for reminders but I no longer get reminders for important events. I now have to go into the calendar app itself to view what is coming up. I'm sick of apologising to people for missed appointments. I use a Note 4.
I actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget. If I make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget?
"The widget, which is the whole reason I downloaded this app, doesn't seem to be updating anymore, even when I click the refresh button. Additionally, there doesn't seem to be a way to mark a task as not completed once you've already marked it as completed."
"Este é um ótimo aplicativo, eu melhorei muito e mudei meus hábitos também, eu realmente gosto desse App.. Obrigado"
Wish I could sync it across multiple devices :(
Not able to buy plants. Unable to sign in.
It's just a skin for Google calendar.
"I really wish this had a website. Setting this up so far has been a pain in the butt. I get maybe they don't allow selecting multiple tasks to prevent cheating or something, but it really is tedious doing the same thing over and over again to 30 habits. Trying to push through it though, we'll see"
Would need an UI refresh.
no notification showing
Good
"Sorry, not Impressed I'm sorry to leave a poor review, but I thought it best to let the developers and others know I had so many challenges with it I wouldn't know where to begin. :( UPDATE: Although I initially gave the app a one star, I upgraded to two because their response was kind and professional. They asked for details of the challenges I had with the app and were genuinely pleasant to correspond with. So if you have a complaint, share kindly because they really do care. :)"
Notifications fixed. App keeps getting better. I'd like to suggest being able to use habit generation as an unlock condition for achievements. Edit: Nice :D Another thing I would suggest is add the date when an achievement was unlocked (example: unlocked 01/04/2019) so we can also order them by this date when looking the unlocked tab. Thanks for this app!
"Love it so far! Excited for the ""coming soon"" items. I use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout I want but so far this seems to be a great replacement!"
"At first glance I really liked it, but I'm having a problem where if I have a recurring task that is past due, none of the new tasks get generated until I complete the old one. And the old task's notification disappears after a few hours if I don't get to it on time. This causes me to constantly miss things if I can't get to it right away"
I don't like to put on google calendar every schedule
1 star for obligatory signup using Google /fb/twitter.
sup
Very user friendly. Highly to keep your schedule organized
"Works fine, unless you want integration with Google Calendar. It's evidently broken (reddit is filled with bug reports), and it seems they're still working on it. I hope it gets fixed soon, so I can upgrade to premium"
I have not used it right now I will download it and sharing my experience if this has changed my life or not
"Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium."
Used to be so great but for the new updates.. What's the point of Deep Focus option? It was well when it was simple and effective..
"Really great, like the pomo. If the completed tasks can be rearraged in a different order instead of being defaulted as follow an alphabetical order that'll be perfect"
It's pretty good so far. I'm still working on coordinating it with my other organisational apps.
"It's working, but the ads are getting really annoying."
"Good and most practical application. But if app's widget could show date, day and current task and next task only or With customization option like that... This would be just awesome..."
I don't care for the dashboard
Best
"I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free."
"I paid for this app, and it was a wonderful app, easy platform, customisable. BUT, there has been a recent addition of ads. All the time! For an app I have paid for I think this is disgusting. I response to you, no these aren't spam events linked to my phone. I uninstalled this app and used my original paid version of the called app and there are no ads. I was prompted to update to this version a while ago. I thought it was just an ad on from the paid version of business calendar I had."
"Can only track five habits without premium 🙄🙄 five habits I can just write down in a notebook instead of waiting my time with this app, I wanted to use it to build good habits for 2019 but I'm not gonna pay money to do something I can do with a pen and paper"
"Enough with the pop-up ads! I don't mind if an app has ads, but if I'm going to be interrupted by a 15 second video every 5 seconds while I'm checking off my list I'm deleting your app. And no, I'm not going to subscribe just because you keep popping up the subscription page. If I have to pay to make the app decently usable, you may as well require I pay for it to begin with."
"Have relied on this app for work since it 1st came out. Great for project management & tracking/budgeting time. REQUESTS: • Please bring back hourly repeat function (i.e. Set an event to repeat every 3 hours). It was a useful Interval timer. • CHROME EXTENSION or online version (as paid user, I'd pay more for this). • Increase maximum # of days for atypical routines, with option to create monthly routines. • Sync Google tasks & reminders (in addition to events). 2-way sync w/Google Thanks!"
"The concept is inventive, but the execution simply makes this app less than enticing to use."
"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance."
"Great app, lots of ads"
"I love the app, but you cannot add file to your task or schedule, this lack of ability to add file on such good app make it incomplete, I could have rated it 5"
"I had a 5 star on this but recent updates have made it far less simple to edit tasks, 3x more taps first to open and then change then get out of the added window that opens. Also it is now impossible to select amd edit in bulk. Poor consideration of basic use cases on part of developers and testers."
"Edit: Fixed with a recent update. Thank you for the fast solution! Unfortunately, a recent update has disabled one of the most important use cases for me: The ability to see all tasks relevant to today at once, which are not just the today todos, but also those overdue, otherwise those tasks are just getting more and more late if you forget to check the other filter. Just make the filter optional again please."
"Pros: I like the design overall. Reminders work well. I think the black theme is great for reducing eye strain. Cons: The search feature is lacking - if I search a single word, it may return tasks with that word in the details before tasks with that word in the title (which I would expect to see first). Task in multiple tags don't always display as expected. Can't 'select all' or 'select all by tag' to batch postpone/schedule. Can't see total # of tasks in a day selected in calendar view."
"Using this apps, i can guarantee you will never remember one single task. Needs more improvements to be classified under reminders category."
Good app
Please reduce the font size in widget so that more items can be shown in a smaller window. There are not so many options so it shouldn't be any issues with click target size etc. Check how Google Calendar widget shows information in agenda mode.
"It requires some pretty intense permissions in order to provide the best experience. It may work for you, but it didn't really work well for me."
"I've been trying to figure out how to have a custom time set for the ""add notification"" options, and there doesn't seem to be any way. For example, I need to set it to 1 hour and 30 minutes, but there's no option for that. We need the ability to enter exactly the number of minutes and hours we want, instead of only having presets.  EDIT: Now after using it for a while, the app has been plagued with reliability issues. It often is late with the notification by a few minutes, or the service completely stops and I'd have to restart the service. Due to this issue, I cannot rely on this app for anything that is time-sensitive because I'd end up being late for all my appointments and jobs. I've contacted the developer multiple times about this but so far they haven't been able to fix the issue."
Is the feature of different colours for different tasks available for the free version too ?? I m actually not able to set it that way. No sir... I did the way u told me to do... It is still not showing different colours
I have an issue of widget stretching. Are there any debugs?
"The best. But, customer service is the worst. You're in luck if they respond. Getting your queries and bugs solved however is near to impossible."
"Excellent to help get organized, to dos, lists...havent used all features yet but looking to learn and utilize. U"
The notification and alarm functions don't work.
After the mandatory change from Wunderlost the app worked wothout issue until today. The app signed out of the MS account for some reason and it just kept crashing endlessly and prevented the use of my phone. Why? I also had to sign in multiple times to be able to get it right. Why change it fron Wunderlist to do a worse job? Why break something that was working?
"I'm so happy that I found this app , I've been having problems sleeping at night and for months I couldn't sleep finally I searched up ""Calming"" and this came up , at first I was like ""ugh it's not gonna help"" but now I am so thankful I found this app it's so smoothing and I can grow my trees and listen to calming music! So I fall asleep and my trees grow! Thank you so much for making this all , I love that you can turn off your phone and the app continues to grow my trees and play music!🌳🌲"
"Cancer notifications. I denied the app permissions it asked for one time when trying to change the notification sound. Now it is impossible to change or mute the sound, no matter what setting I change inside or outside the app, and whether or not I give the app the permissions it wanted. 4 stars when this is fixed."
"I really liked the app and had been using it for a few weeks. But a while ago whenever I would open the app, it would load for a bit but then freeze and crash if I tapped anything. The rest of my phone still works fine (doesn't freeze) while this happens. Is there anything I can do to fix this? I would love to continue using this app. Thank you! (And I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling.) Edit: Clearing did solve the problem for now. Too bad I had to give up all the progress I made. But thank you anyway, at least I can use the app again."
"This app sucks its slow and they make you pay to make checklists which is 
ridiculous"
"I've been switching between task apps for years, this seems the most intuitive and allows me to be the most productive. Quite a few features are paid for though, and although I would be willing to pay a larger upfront fee, a monthly fee isn't a commitment I'd be willing to make"
"The best habit tracker app I've seen, would've done 5 stars, but I feel like something's missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it"
"Incredibly useful service and thanks so much for creating it. The app tends to be buggy, but nothing that couldn't easily be worked around until the last update. Since the last update drag and drop sorting of To Do (and I suspect Dailies as well) subtasks/checklists no longer works which is really frustrating. At least the website works great as always. It's just frustrating to have to run down to the computer to fix my lists."
No reminder for tasks
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well."
only 5 hapits for free
This is a great app and I am getting a lot more done than I was before. The only downside is that the premium subscription is a little pricey for a todo app. Seems like a lot of companies are opting for subscriptions to keep the gravy train coming instead of allowing us to buy the app outright. I'd rather own it outright than pay every year or month.
"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced. Without it it's just a list tool with inconvenient UX, limited possibilities of organizing your tasks, absolutely useless and badly calculated karma and overpriced premium. Would not recommend to anybody - there are tons of better tools."
Even after 2 years the sync is still garbage? Wow just wow...
Good app
Nice app but UX can be improved.
good but needs a true Black background option with white letters. dark grey isn't Black
I love pies. Why not make my daily schedule one! Easy to use and links to existing calendars.
"Not a big user, but my use is very satisfactory"
"Happy with the App...but personally I had two issues which are if addressed, may provide sort of convienience to the users. 1. If any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that I felt inconvenient to write the task again. 2. If any task is being feeded and there also undo/redo options are not available"
New version and now I have to wait 30 seconds and watch an ad! Just wanted to take a look at my schedule today. This is unacceptable! 30 seconds!
"A clean and simple app that I've used for a long time now. It's really been helpful for scheduling various errands, tasks and events in my calendar. Its simplicity makes it really easy to use in daily life. Highly recommended."
Terrible
"(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move"
"You're good guys. Your efforts are admirable Please consider making the app 
available to milions of people and support ""rtl""."
Please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot. It serves no purpose if I can't tell what it's for. Get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating. UX should never be an afterthought.
Very good
Resonse (2/13/20): I know that the free version is not ad-free.  The issue that what you have done recently is to force people to watch ads instead of just clicking them away. And this happens while I'm trying to add or edit something on the calendar. Had to change from 5 to 1 star because of these pop up ads. Will be looking for a new app soon.
I've looked at about every app out there to organize tasks. This is by FAR the best out there. I've not found another with this much flexibility. I actually have not found anything I don't like about the app. Fits my every need. Great job!
"Great app! But have a few suggestions that would make it the best app in the market! Trust me people are looking for this! 1) The ability to add your schedule with a few clicks. For example you can set reoccuring events, but peoples schedules alternate. Would be great to be able to click the days you work group then at the same time and categorize them under work. (For reference look at the nursegrid app) 2) add your spouse or family directly. So everything is synced real time.(familywall)"

"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!"
its a great app but need to add a version were you can restore your notes if lost my app got erased by accident and i dont have any of my notes saved please consider adding to the app
this is a super helpfull app. It really motivates me to stay focussed and easily tracks my hours. I would however like to continue growing a tree after a short break in stead planting a new one. I work for short periods of time separated by 5 to 10 minute breaks. As a result I can't grow any trees beyond the first stage. I hope this feature could be added.
Love Planner Pro to keep up with tasks and appointments. Optional alarms for meetings and events are very helpful to keep me on track.
"All to do lists should embrace habit monitoring. Also, I like it when a pending task persists on the list until it's done or removed."
Better than todoist! I never thought I'll move away from todoist but it lacked some important features that TickTick has. Got the pro version. It's the only service I'm paying monthly for.
"Can be better, can be made more attractive and everything else is good"
It has helped me to increase my study time from 1to 3 hours in one study lap
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this
"Work well as my need, except it can not be watch face on Samsung watch. I try it several days and love it. So I purchase the pro version, wish to use it on my watch as it said can be used with Android. I didn't know that Samsung watch is different OS, so it's incompatible :( However, the developer show responsibility by refunding the money. Anyway, I still hope it will be able to use with Samsung watch soon. Keep up the good work!"
I have been using this app for years. What l especially like is the simplicity of use..
Recurring reminders feature is not available. Let's say I want to do a particular task every day and want to have a reminder daily. I tried for it using this app but it does not work.
phone app is great and syncs well but windows app always jumbles my tasks so i would recommend using online app on your computer
"It's a good app, looks polished and nice. Only problem I have is I have some tasks that repeat themselves even after I complete them, I've editted that they only come once a day but forever stay on the today tasks"
This app is being killed in the background whatever i do. I have given all the permissions. But still it is being killed. My phone is oppo A5. Please do something Devs.
Love it!! Love that it keeps what I did that day forever and crosses it out!! Just like on a piece of paper and you can have a note section!!!
"Might be good, but it doesn't have task library and trying to set everything up myself is not worth it."
Has potential but you gotta pay
"I upgraded to Pro after a couple of weeks & initially excited about the app. Having used it for a while now I'm starting to regret my purchase. There are some pros but more cons. It's buggy, doesn't sync well at all across devices, the UI is very cluttered, the forum needs serious updating, a search tool for eg. The last update was ages ago, given how pricey this is you'd think the developers would make it worth it but they seem to have disappeared!"
I loved this app before but now for some reason notifications do not pop up and I'm missing out on really important reminders.
It's notification tune is frequency low
Its most timewasting app instead! I downloaded this for schedule n it asks to buy a pro version for it! It should be mentioned first before we dwnld this app!
"Whuup, sorry, need to pay for unlimited daily task. Nope"
"I love this app! It's a perfect replacement for my paper calendar. I love that I can have my schedule, meal plan, tasks to do and more all at the tip of my fingers wherever I am. I'm excited for all the plans they have to add even more awesome features!"
"TickTick looks like a powerful and flexible productivity app but I find the help and support information across platforms somewhat overwhelming and confusing. I think that (for the easily confused) it would benefit from a good tidy-up, beginning with a clear conceptual overview of the design philosophy and architecture of the product and the methodology of its use, including flow diagrams and examples, before any specific platform advice."
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.
it is very nice game for studying
"This app is productive but the only annoying thing happened with me is that when I tried to open this app on the next day after downloading it,it was not opening I tried so many times ...."
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
I love this app. Only thing that annoys me is how marking a task as complete in one device doesn't dismiss notifications on the others. :(
Good
"Sounds like a wonderful idea for time management, but it won't show half of the things on my calendar and kind of ruins the entire purpose."
"It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package."
"Would be great, but the layout doesn't actually let you succeed in adding 
habits. Thus, useless."
"I subscribed to premium version and it was just working perfect I rate it 5 star but after latest update icon widget is not working. One more issue is there, in agenda view hide declined view option not actually working and declined events are keep showing for the whole day"
Love it! So clean
Love the app! 10/10. Most effective easily in this category.
Just works great app.
Hesitant to buy premium. I feel like currently the only reason to buy premium is to have more than 7 habits and to make it look pretty. I'm on a budget and if I'm spending $5 I certainly want more bang for my buck. I wish the developers offered more in premium to make it worth the price.
App install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks. So you have to pay to use this app. This is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install.
"Needs to access data on device, events can't be entered manually"
"Great idea, it needs some improvements imo. Edit: after playing for a while i noticed some things that definitely need improvement. Faster loading times when changing sections or when receiving items, you shouldn't have to refresh to see them. That also applies when feeding pets where i dont see a progress in the bar unless i refresh. Etc."
"This Agenda has changed my life. I can easily switch between family, business and personal calendars. I can color code events and the tasks lists have made my followups in business, and my daily home tasks seamless. Im no longer the mom losing my mind (as much anyway). I HIGHLY recommend!!!!"
Everytime I wanted to swap between month /day it lags so much.. If only it was smooth then I am very excited with the app.. I am using lenovo a7-3000
Loved it. Use it to reach and track your set goals.
Great app and service! The user base is amazing and the staff is awesome. No notification when a challenge ends and no way to automatically remove its associated tasks. Can't read the full text of challenge tasks before joining. The health/experience widget doesn't display any information.
"Best one out there. However, I would like to see a swipe feature on the widget to archive or delete as oppose to a button to delete to prevent accidental touching. Turning off auto hide is a bit long winded to delete each task. 5stars if this gets added."
"Have you heard of that saying, ""Where did the time go""? Well this app helps me stay on schedule with my day instead of it just disappearing with nothing accomplished. Love the interface and very user friendly."
so good
Good app for task but should be linked with reminders.
"It was working fine until recently, I bought new bush but when I have successfully planted (it told me it was successful) I saw it planted the last tree I had chosen on previous study session and 4 out of 7 trees were dead (even tho it said I planted 7 successful trees). The notification also doesn't work"
"Amazing app. This really really helps me to increase my productivity, and to keep a note of the things which I need to do. And thank you so much for the cross platform support, I can access my tasks over my pc or anywhere I want. This app solved several problems of mine"
"I didn't understand how to add subtask in ""template"". I pressed ""save as template"", but it saved only the name of template. I couldn't find any information about template in ""help centre"". Please explain me how to add subtask in template."
"I find the app amazing. It is one of the best habit apps that I've used. The only thing I don't like is that I've bought the premium but I don't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I really needed was to have more than 7 habits but, the rest is just decoration. It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them. Another thing that would do this app just perfect, would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer. Other than that, I recommend to download it. Keep doing it so!"
"Excellent way to gamify your personal habits, with many levels of customization so you can set the difficulty levels of tasks as well as the level of self improvement those tasks provide."
"It's a good app but can be better I want the developer to fix the following please: 1-when you work with it sometimes it becomes laggy and you need to force stop and restart the app 2-when you type in it in Persian the symbols like ""?, (,), etc"" doesn't align correctly 3 - if you add some native calendars like Persian calendar to it it will become more useful (and also an option to set it as main calendar not like Google alternative calendars that show Gregorian months not Persian months ex.)"
"Recurring tasks are very glitchy - they sometimes change the day or time when they recur. Per any.do's request i sent them a video of this happening... crickets. No explanation or acknowledgement and no refund as i requested. Fine otherwise, but i rely on recurring items."
"Goooodddd benerrrrrr, so helpfulllllll"
"Please keep tinkering, and improving. Thank you for this app"
"Been using this for a long time, tremendous improvements from then up to now. Great job.!"
"I wanted to like this app. It's a very convenient way to see all the info I need right on the screen, but when I click on the task button I get trapped on the task screen with no way back. I have to kill the app to restart it in the clock visualization mode."
Helps me stay organized..
"Calendar integration is okay but buggy and quirky. Can't see calendar events in daily view without changing settings to show in all lists. Organize view can't use custom lists to plan my week. The sync with Google is unforgivably poor. If I change a calendar event it takes up to a day to reflect in TickTick. This is so bad I have begun looking for replacement. I would like to see a better support forums for community feedback. Often answers are basically ""suck it up, that's just the way it is""."
Enjoying the app.
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.
Not as good compared to other apps. Not a very user frndly interface and essential features like reminders are pro features.
I really like this apps cos it allows me to plan weekly schdules which is very important to me.
I love this planner it keeps me on schedule and I can write in Notes to clock hour's
In the latest update the widgets don't work. The app is set to dark mode but the widgets aren't. Also cannot change lists or add to lists through the widget.
"This App is useless , it works as a notepad with your tasks in it , it does not notify you of tasks you suppose to do. When the time reaches it's silent doesn't pop up even though settings have permitted it to pop up and alert , even a simple alarm clock notified me of what to do .This app Doesn't work ."
"Сам сервис очень крутой, но пожалуйста сделайте более понятный интерфейс для «Habits», пусть они они становятся серыми или изчезают, когда человек отметил свой прогресс за день. Я банально не помню, отмечала я свой прогресс сегодня или ещё нет, а показатель в виде цифры или зелёного/рыжего цвета мне ни о чем не говорит."
Good
Track future and historical vary well.
Been using for a week and so far it's the best planner/Todo app I've tried.
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.
"It's easy enough to use as it is, but for a fully paid app, the graphs are incredibly lackluster and basically useless. All you get is some minuscule, measly bar graphs which are tiny...and get this, they don't even label the metric you're tracking as they are displayed in the order in which your goal list is. So unless you memorize that goal #7 is say exercise daily, you won't even know what you're looking at. Additionally, the streaks are glitchy as hell, and often times do not calculate correctly. Really wish they also had aggregate goals, for example grouping similar goals together and then tracking the success percent for the aggregate. Like say if you have multiple diet goals for no dairy, no gluten, and no sugar, it would be great to group those in the diet category and then see your success there overall and trending graphs. And come on, add some pie charts and the ability to look at graphs in intervals aside from a single month."
"Slowly but Steadily improve my performance and productivity on learning. Keep all us excited with more features, thank you."
"My biggest problem is that there's no free trail and a lot of stuff is behind the pay wall but I'd like to try before I buy. Also, as a first time user there's a few issues: I downloaded it on my tablet and landscape mode doesn't work well for all pages (especially the habit details page). There was also no tutorial so I was left to just click around (when I later downloaded it on my phone there was a tutorial so I'm not sure why there isn't on my tablet)."
This app so helpful to meet
Great
I have questions that i would like to have answered and i have emailed numerous times with no reponse back. They say dont write negative reponses to this app without contacting us first. I did email for answers but no one will answer my questions. My questions are not bad for this app but the people behind this app are terrible business people. So this could be a great app but service is terrible. Which instead of getting 4 or 5 stars im giving 2 should be 1 but app is good the ones behind the app are bad just want to take peoples money and then laugh at us by not helping
"While I love the app and it's customizablity, I have some issues; repeats are confusing and not easy to work about (for instance repeat times during one day and repeat times period), how difficult it is to move tasks to different days, can set specific times on reminders, difficult time building routines versus todos on it, and how hard it is to hide tasks on the calendar that should be hidden in subtasks, change easy to lose, and unable to manually order tasks by preference."
Wow! I love how well it integrates with Google's Home products. Verbally adding items to my various to do lists as well as my grocery list is awesome!!
"It's OK...but NOT free really! Costs 5 bucks to get basoc fratures on/annouying ads off. I don't feel like investing in something that in the end may or may not work out, while there are many systems that could easily replace this app. The 'routines' can be easily called 'recurring tasks' and that feature is offered by almost every respectable calendar app. Free 60 trial period would encourage me, but sneaking in payment under the label of 'free' app is what annoys me on principle! Don't do it!"
This app is perfect for getting work done and is a great way to keep track of progress!
"The best looking todo app I could find, very complete. Would be the one I use but... Unfortunately sync with Google calendar takes hours, up to a day. The issue seems to be a couple of years old (you can check it in the customer section on their website), and nothing was done to address it, while the competition syncs in seconds. If you don't need Google sync, then it's great. I'm now using another app. Sad."
"Free version does what I need, with the exception of undelete when accidentally clicking the wrong thing. However the cost of pro version too much for just that feature"
I used to love this app but since my phone updated it no longer works. I recently uninstalled and re installed I hope it works or I'll have to find something new 🙁
Update: It would make more sense to have the schedule tab as just the schedule layed out where you have the time of day scale to the left ( editable show just hours or hours and minutes) and then the activity from the routine/s at the correct time. And the only way to edit the routine could be only through the routine tab (as thats where I assume you want the main part to edit routines to be). But I love how you can save different routines for each day. Not to sure what programmer is for?
"Wonderful, but please give total version in less amount of price"
"Easy to use, sleek design. Love the funny option for the daily reminders. Keeps me focused."
Perfect works but please add more hours to focus because 3 hours is too short for me. And add Indonesia language.
Many features are available just for premium
Its great for quick reminders with events just weird its 30 min before by default i wanna change that alsoo every 3 and 6 months reminder be USEFUL and a must pls like toothbrush replace reminder.
Why i can't open the room from the link that people share . Every time i have to write the code to join . It's really annoying .
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it"
"I enjoyed using this app for over the past 2 years to improve my life, even if it was by a little bit. The community is kind and friendly. But I think it would be better if you could filter out what type of guild you want to join. I don't want to spend too much time scrolling down just to find the right guild."
Wish it didn't force me to use Google calendar. I wanted to start a new calender off of this app
"I think i found my perfect to do app! I'm pleased that I was able to use the same features I was using from an old app and do it on this one, plus more! It's so easy to organize and visualize all your tasks. The appearance of the app overall is excellent."
always freezing
Widget keeps reverting to my day. It didn't before. Also now often unresponsive. This change is incredibly frustrating. Please fix bugs then happy to upgrade review rating as otherwise us good. Thank you
"Not able to show the notification after the time is up. Also, it is not able to function well on counting the exceeded time or shown incorrectly. It would be of great help if you could fix the problems. Thank you:)"
"I like this app, because it fits well in my daily routines and offers very many settings, especially regarding appearance. It has some basic design flaws and misses some easy opportunities, but all in all it is a valuable application for my personal time management."
With the latest update it seems that when I update the frequency for one task it messes up the frequency and repeat days of the week for another task which is annoying as I was using the app to track my weekly tasks
Why is it being linked with my google calendar or phone calendar? I don't want this private app to access my Google calenders and phone calender. Instead you should have just added the feature of adding tasks within the app. I'm deleting this. The UI is great. But I don't want you to link with my private apps.
"I tried hundreds of apps and thousands of ways for being focused, nut nothing helped me then I found this app and I am staying focused. This is the best one."
"Its a wonderfull app, helps in keeping a track of your habits and how consistent you are with it"
"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)"
This is worst task game in my life
Crashes all the time
"Quality, very helpful, when busy, helps track tasks and keeps dates passed as well."
I'm two years premium subscriber for the app. It seems great but the only thing makes all the benefits disappear for me: inability to see all finished tasks by label. Guys it's high time you added this to Android and Mac. Doesn't seem any difficult.
Helpful and easy to use. Really good app for students or people who struggle with remembering tasks they have to get done.
"Thank you for responding and I'm looking forward to that update (customized categories). Another improvement I'd love to see are more options for a goal besides a daily one, such as save $100 per week, etc. I got the Premium and love the dark theme, this app is the best I've found for my needs. Thank you!"
"Reminder sometime not working, so i must restart the reminder. Please fix it"
"Very useful, great clock widget with my schedule. It is better if can open calendar app by touched widget."
"I paid only a few bucks for premium, and now I have it for life. I love it!"
"I had a problem with upgrading to Premium. They were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away. It's a good app for those familiar with the Franklin Covey system, and syncs well across devices."
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking."
Perfect
"Recurence tasks does not work properly, otherwise I would give 4 starts."
"Find a new app. Overall if you havent noticed, the dev's left this app. As of recently, the servers are dead. This means you cant make an account, forums are gone, motivation pictures gone, etc. Find a new app,"
Very well done for improving your task management. Only the lack of badge count for android phone is loosing the 5 stars review
"Great helping app, would be 5 if events won't disappear occasionally, possibly because calendar is shared between two gmails"
"The app keeps crashing every day, and wouldn't open. Every morning I got to reinstall it and log in again... What's wrong..."
"App is so much good , best app , i want to give 5 star but not giving so that u can notice me . After its update ,my app is not opening il, if i reinstall it , my coins will lost and trees also . Please help me what to do"
"I'm in love with the app. It motivates me a lot and really helps to stay on track. Apart from the cool gamified features, it also has a huge and very friendly community, where you can get support and answers to pretty much any questions."
I like this app but it's always saying it has stopped on my phone
"Jury is still out.....would be more than happy to review.....if i was actually given the time to do so before the ""rate me rate me"" messages."
Love it! Thanks
The tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand I have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
"[1] Pls put additional sounds like instrumental music, campfire, etc. [2] an option where you can study unlimited and stop it anytime you want and still get coins [3] If the tag is changed DURING the planting process, it should reflect separately the time spent by the previous tag as well as that of the new tag so that the overall distribution is at its peak accuracy. Will put 5 stars afterwards."
"Very good at what it does, but doesn't come close to warranting a monthly charge."
Could not get the app to save event time properly. All I wanted was to put a due date between 11:50 p.m. and 11:59 p.m. on a certain day. WOULD NOT do it. The app kept automatically changing my times. That's annoying enough for me to ditch it and move on.
"After years using Wunderlist we move on. It works. The thing missing to me is that I can not get a simple view that shows items overdue, due today, coming up in the next week . I need to look in multiple views. I have the usability issue of having to fiddle with it to toggle between today, this week, overdue, etc. I can not default to a view that gives me the information I need at a glance. I suppose I can look at ""all"" but that gives a never ending list. For me, this is a step backwards."
"bought premium version, didn't get upgrade, sent proof of payment, still no response. not good"
As I am a regular user of this app...This app needs some update like the calendar based listing method. People will go to date and list the task...Another problem is so many color for list. It's annoying... Who don't like colors they can select one color for every task list... That is all...🙂🙂🙂
Awesome app.
"Perfect, I'm loving every element so far ,I love that I can at some point once it's all done use it like my paper planner and sync them with my phone, I hate carrying my paper planner and also having to update my cell calendar , I love and cant wait to see and use all the coming soons I'm so excited ,I'm hoping also a widget will be something to come soon as well so that I can have it open on my phone and not always have to open the app for quick reference. Keep it up"
Hi I like this app 😍 it could be better if the todo list's tasks were sorted by their deadline and also today's tasks had a different color!! And a reward could be a game which needs some coins to play them! Thank you!!
I like the design and ease. Best habit tracker I've found.
I really love this app 👍
"I unistalled just for the costumer service. I was ready and willing to give the app a shot. But given the cruel, uncaring, and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works I will be uninstalling imediately."
Very easy to use. Definitely recommend.
"Helped me make a streak! I am a person who starts an activity with excitement but loses interest eventually, most likely before a week. But this app made me continue because i had to punch everyday. When i crossed 4 days it felt like I should not let it go to waste,let me continue. And then activity like drinking 3L of water everyday was easy to achieve. So when i made a one-week streak of that, the app congratulated me and built more excitement. Rest is history! 💛"
"Only day one but WOW. It's dumb how distracted we get from our phones. This has kept me focused for 45min study sessions during they day, with 30 min breaks. The material I'm studying is so dry so this really helps. If it keeps working I'll upgrade to premium. Also downloaded the night version. Keep up the good work!!!"
"Easy to use App, easy to move items up and down the list and organize categories. Like this app better than the Wunderlist app I used to have."
"In general, the app is confusing. Repeating tasks work for some time and then stop working. I have not found any clear logic behind this. The same problem was with wunderlist. Not recommended."
"I'm a student and was looking for something get myself very organized. I have tried series of productivity apps before. Apparently this had one of the features i have always been looking for; integration with other apps which I love. Two things I found disappointing, features are extremely limited without premium, it's almost impossible to use like that also very expensive. I couldn't find statistics; from totally hours and other reports"
Please allow line wrap for a event tile in the month widget and/or month-style display
Elevates your productivity. Very neat and organized app
"My favorite habit-gamification app so far, after trying a few. Definitely minimalistic compared to Habitica, but it makes up for it in just being more functional, and with a much better system for attaching relative value/importance to various habits/to-do tasks/etc. All habit apps face the fact that it's hard to put actual numbers to how much a good habit should be ""worth"", and that scoring points you set can feel a bit like digging up treasure you buried. Do It Now handles it all well, tho"
i like the idea of planting trees and making a forest..which is really satisfaying. But this app doesn't notify me when the timer is up and it's time for break.. i have to check if the timer is still running and then set the break myself..which is the worst part! and it doesn't allow me to set multiple timer with breaks in between! if they can fix these issues..it would be a useful app
...And more!
"It works! Does what it's supposed to do, although I don't require any features other than setting an appointment/event, and being reminded of it. Unobtrusive, even when using it as a free version only. I'll probably upgrade to PRO just to reward the developer. Edit: The new 30 second ads really screw this up."
"I'm so disappointed. I've used this app for years as it was one of the best calendar apps, but now the obtrusive video ads that hold you hostage have completely changed the experience. I finally had to uninstall it because it's to the point where it's just too much. I'm understanding about banner ads if you don't want to buy the Pro version, but this is unacceptable."
"The app is good but a FAQ would be appreciated. For example, I cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks."
Good
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!
"It's actually good but then stopped working effectively since a week ... suddenly it stops and I couldn't open it...so, had to uninstall and install many a times, I also lost all my productivity due to it's sudden shutdown...mine is a pro version too..this is so bad and testing our patience.. please fix the issue.! Thankyou."
"The app itself is great, but they've started adding unskippable ads. It locked my phone and forced me to go through an ad disguised as a video game where I had to shoot criminals just to make an appointment. I had no problem with static ads to support the developers, but locking my phone until I played a dumb game ruined the app for me."
"Worst app I have ever used, it doesn't do anything."
Haven't been using this app for long but it seems great so far. I LOVE that incompleted tasks roll over to the current day. I just wish you could attach attach photos or files to your notes. That would make this a 5-star review.
"Worked really well, however the widgets work for a day then won't respond unless removed and re-added. . . Eevveerryy day. won't remember to actually use it without the widgets, so its useless now. not worth paying extra."
"why do not work reminders repeated monthly at all? one-time yes, repeated no. what is wrong?"
"I got this app to setup a schedule to work from home, and it's been good for that. I just set up a bunch of habits at the right time each day. The widget has been handy too to keep my schedule on my home screen. The app could do to look a bit more modern. But all of my reminders come exactly 3 minutes late? Every notification for a habit comes exactly 3 minutes late (i.e. reminder set to 2:00PM, notification arrives at 2:03PM, etc.). Developers?"
"The app is good, but there are glitches. After some time when the person tries to open the app. It showed to clear the data of the app. This deletes all the storage of the app the coins collected, the forest made. This leads to the disruption of the person's analysis of their focussed work. Hope you'll soon rectify this error. And hope the soon comes early."
"this was a great idea in theory, but I want a standalone app that doesn't pull calendar data from some other app. for me and for how I wanted to use this app to manage my schedule, this just won't work. I think it could also be more user-friendly. a shame, since this really is an amazing, unique idea. devs, I hope you keep working on this and take this as constructive criticism. I would love to try this app again if things change and it becomes a more flexible standalone calendar."
Pretty good reminder app. The recurring reminders don't seem to work very well though. I'll get a reminder for the first occurrence and then nothing for any of the following events. There doesn't appear to be a way to acknowledge the original alarm without deleting it or marking the entire series as complete.
I was looking for a class schedule app and this was not it
Should have an option to add reminders. it only displays events
I have not been using app for very long. Therefore the 3 star rating. After some use I will return to rate again.
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app
"Good for keeping lists of tasks and working through them. It is worth taking time to learn the different ways to use and organise the app. Sometimes it seems to be working against me eg in certain views, I can't drag tasks up and down a list or can't see them ordered by subject. [Edit follows, to respond to Todoist's reply:] Thanks for replying. Yes, as you say, ""sorting in filtered views is not possible"". Or to use non-developer language, ""Ugghhh, why can't I sort this list by project or in another way that suits me?"" This is the one thing that I dislike strongly about an otherwise excellent app. Wunderlist had better sorting and Tick Tick has it. I would love to see this change in Todoist."
"Everything is perfect, except for the fact that daily reminders on habit check feature doesn't work."
"Beutiful and easy to use once you get used to it however I wished creating 
an event was a bit more simple and quick. Update: no longer syncs to my 
calender and the dates are all messed up....too bad I loved it"
Excellent app
Nice app but doesn't really have what I'm looking for.
"Confusing without a lot of explanation on what is what. Might be good when I figure it out, but it's not a real intuitive app and has a figure it out curve."
"Seems like a really awesome app, but blocks stuff behind a subscription or a buy all one time payment. Would rather pay piece meal. It also has ads in the free version that you can't get rid of without the sub or $50 buy all."
As someone who has eternally struggled to build and maintain habits this has made it so easy for me. I've had the app about a week (upon writing this review) and already I'm remembering my habits without prompts. I absolutely intend to buy the full version when possible and I have already recommended the app to multiple friends of mine. Absolutely great app.
It's a quite useful program. Works reliably.
You have to pay for all the decent features... There's nothing you want to do that your alarm doesn't already do
"SO USEFUL!! I struggle with ADHD on a daily basis, I can never remember to do simple tasks and things like notebooks, whiteboards, stickynotes, alarms, they just Don't Work. But this app helps change the game dude!! It's a clever way to incentivize completing tasks, and it's helping me build better habits with the reminders and penalties for not completing it if you miss it. SUPER USEFUL!! I feel more productive and motivated to get my tasks done, I'm grateful this app exists"
"I totally recommend this app. It had help me on every possible way. It's really helpful if you really want to develop a new habit. I specialy like the easyness to configure the habits and the reminders; the motivational notes that you can find around are just right. But its true that is not a magic app, PLEASE if you want to create a new habit, you have to work for it, you have to work to create something. If you do that, you'll see the true colors of this magnificent app. Be true to yourself."
auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.
Not user friendly. Almost impossible to delete or edit lists. Format is garbage.
I have so many things in the writing in the lists :D
It doesn't reset or set you reminders but it helps
"After testing the app for a while, I was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on Android. Do you know when it would be available? Also, is there a one time fee purchase option? Is there a GMAIL integration feature? Like Google Tasks? I like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app 👍. Nice work on the Widgets 👍. Thanks 🙂"
Great feature is reminder to reorganize missed and undone tasks. But ui of the app looks confusing to me. I cat find a way to add tasks easyly enought gor me. i dont know what next. google tasks are simplier and todoist have limited features in free version.
"This is the free version. The paid version is $7.99, the Platinum version is even more. You can only track 5 habits in the free version. Developers must be paid, but a lack of up front honesty makes this product undesirable. (I should charge for this.) Do not install. #doughymiddle"
Decent app with good features allowing for good habbit tracking but I am unable to reschedule dates on the habits. I have to delete the habit then remake it with the revised dates which is a big hassle
"It's just an ordinary built-in timer, with enhanced graphics, which doesn't notify at the completion of duration set. No other purpose it serves."
"Awesome app! Smart natural language syntax support for task management, cool UX and multi-device sync."
Another perfect mobile application ! Should send competitors teams to UI/UX design board. Excellent/perfect (hard) work !
The concept is good. But why the app is not notifying me about thr task even though I have turned the notification on? This is very bad.
The app is not upto the mark 1. Notification window is not there 2. Chat window is not available on every task
"This is a good app.... but the only problem is I cant use it properly.... because if I have planted a tree and come back to plant another one.... or to use any option in the app, I cant do it. It shows that ""unfortunately forest has stopped "".... there is no problem with my phone.... please repair this problem.... I liked the app.... but this problem is just annoying me...."
Features are good but i strongly recommend you to not install this app. Waste of time. Without any reason they freezed my account two times in one night.
I loved the franklin planners and this is as close as it comes so good job
"Awful, can't barely open it up. Just black screen on the main activity and that's it. No reboot or reinstall helped. Fix asap."
"App is completely broken. Can't even make an avatar -- none of the options show up. Also, get an error message when trying to show a display name"
osm app but now its update an I am not able to see my all reminders that I use to remind my self before uninstalling the app
Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.
"I wanted to like it... I've always drooled at the idea of having a to do list app integrate with a calender. But alas, this version is clunky. You can't delete a single date of a recurring calender event, meaning you can't flexibly plan your day while beginning with a rough outline. I switched over to to-doist and Google calender instead."
"earlier this was a very good apps, suit for me and my activities. But after I installed it on my PC & change my password, the apps on my phone keeps telling me to reset password from web (even though I already did it) :( so now I can't use it on my phone coz every time I try to open the apps, it always making my phone restart"
"Nice idea, but internal app organisation is a mess where you can easily miss a task due for today"
Looks like a pretty good app but it doesn't sync with Alexa. Which is the main reason I installed it. Shouldn't be this difficult.
"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks."
"Way to easy to lose your task as they disapear when checked. Example, I got distracted for 10 seconds with my phone in my hand and ToDoIst app open and when I looked back at my phone 4 task had disappeared and I'm left trying to remember wish task it was! Really bad for an app that suppose to help you organize. I'm uninstalling because of this."
A very intelligent timetable app with amazing design. Totally recommended.
"it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task"
"This app is great! I love the idea of turning my daily life like an RPG game. But I have this goal to wash my face twice everyday and it feels repetitive to make two task for the exact same thing. So can you guys make a task where it has to be done twice before the said task is completed? Been trying my hardest to do this on your app, even finished reading the user guide, but it still wouldn't work."
Feature request: 1. undo delete or bin option 2. option to adjust snooze period (remind me tmrw mrng for eg.) 3. Option to add milestone to tasks so that it will be easy to keep track of the its progress. 4. Pls add option to change the default timings like 9am 2pm etc. 5. Also while adding a task itself please give option to 'remind me after 30 mins etc' instead of going through date and time adjustment.
Awesome App that has really kept me on track. I just wish there was some type of reward system once you've reached your goal. I think regular reminders (perhaps with some form of motivation attached to it) would also encourage discipline and drive.
Its efficient and so simple to us!
It is easy. Would love to have more sort options. But I keep a lot of lists and keeps me organized.
"Really? $8 for a habit tracker? There are other apps that do the same thing for far less money. I don't mind paying for apps, but this seems like price gouging. Oh, and it's $10 if you want the ability to export your data!"
C'est très bien... mais ça devrait être moins lourd en daya
"DL'd to try this app out, but could not get past the initial setup. Buttons missing labels or information, lethargic loading issues, and the graphics are really sub par for what other games host currently. Even the initial avatar appearance has most things locked behind a pay wall, and keeps putting me in a wheelchair! The idea behind the app has a lot of potential, and would be a joy to see if they can make it better and working properly. Will have to wait and see. As is? Not functional."
Necessary. Needs a little more life and interaction to its graphics
Looks good but it doesn't sync with events from existing calendars. It only syncs the holiday calendar but not my personal calendar.
No Outlook Calendar support. Most business people use Outlook...
The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!
"This app is not so good as a free version. You let us make subtask which is great... but not able to make a reminder is pathetic. For free version users, you can make a certain limit for using reminder. Also it will be great if you add a pomo timer."
"Great all around GTD, Tasks, Reminder. A few that I would like to to see added: 1) add location icon WHEN setting a reminder. 2) In calendar view, a better view showing of the difference between a task and a calendar event. 3) a dedicated shortcut (activities) or widget to add a task by voice."
"Sorry but the migration from Wunderlist made some things worse. The architecture stays the same and this is good but there are some things that are doubtful unfortunately. Why do I need to flag each task to make it appear on ""My Day"" ? If I assign a task for today, I want it to appear already in ""My Day"", otherwise what's the point of this ""My Day""? Not too many customization possibilities, the look of the app is a bit bulk and not so elegant. Some reminders are not working. I hope this can help"
Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!
Works well
"If it wasn't for the fact that the app doesn't offer separate widgets for Work Profile (I personally really need this), I'd give it 5 stars :)"
"Huge amount of functionality in free version. stopped short of 5* because duplicate functionality v limited. When i duplicate tasks I cannot duplicate to any other location than current one and cannot change name, and the new name is set as old name plus ""copied"". Would be very helpful to have duplication functionality that I can copy tasks (or indeed a whole list) and on copying them can have the duplicates placed where I wish and make choice about naming convention"
The app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working. I have bought the pro version.
Bug report - App Alerts I use both Android app (installed on Android 10) & web access. If i solve a task on web access the app also shows closed task. But I still get a push notification for the closed task on Android device
Helped me a lot
"very complex ui, it needs Google calendar and doesn't work without it. I needed a app like this but as a daily planner! not just showing the calendar events from Google Calendar stupidly on a clock."
"So many portions of the app we're not appearing on the screen from the get go, including the first two screens entirely, and even the avartar selections."
Amazing app. I use it everyday and I feel that my life is more organized.
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc"
"I already have a subscription, it's ridiculous that It notices I already had a free trial so it obviously knows my account but its not logging me in with my premium subscription. To top it off I can't ask customer service nothing because it's not an option unless you have the premium that's ridiculous."
"Great To Do list. The only issue is location based reminders seem to be sporadic. Also annoying that you can't set all day tasks, hopefully an update soon. No resolution and tech support slow, a shame."
"Good design, simple and clear but with the option to dig down for more details. However, they don't respond to emails and haven't released an update in over a year. Seems like this project was abandoned."
This is the reason I get straight A's I'm continuing with my studies and doing well in these times.The only problem I have is that once you get use to the rain sounds make focus it takes a WHILE to get use to another sound but in conclusion I really LOVE this app ❤️
"Overnight events (ie 8pm-4am) show up as All Day events in the calendar. If they are repeating, then two All Day events are shown.  Need to fix this ASAP!"
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.
Needs smart dictation like todoist and better calendar widgets like ticktick
"This is so, soooo useful! I love too much to use just ordinary words. Keep doing the good stuff! Y'all rock ~"
Thanks for ruining Wunderlist you jackasses
Tasks don't update their descriptions until you quit and re-open. Can't set more than 7 tasks without paying an absurdly expensive weekly subscription
"Great. Better than todoist cause you can organize how you want in inbox or ""all"" view, despite priority or reminder time. That option is what sets it above. Wish that android reminders were full screen, however or that snooze reminders could be optionabke for time. View in website and windows app also could be draggable for left to right sizing of columns"
"Bought the pro a few years ago. However, recently went to a new phone, and now I'm seeing ads, and it doesnt look like I have the pro version anymore. Not sure what happened but jacked up that I paid for the pro, and unable to get the functionality of the pro version without buying it again."
Good
İntuitive and straightforward approach to calendar.
Want use only not sharing
"This todo list app definately stanfs above the almost the same todo_wonderlist_tasks type of app. I love its flexibility to make your own processes, love the integration of other calendars, love the preset lists, and most importantly i love the widget! I can make a todo list widget on one screen, and my shopping list widget on the other. Plus I can make each lines super tight to see the list without to constantly scrolling up and down. Great app."
I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.
the app looks great. alot of function. it wouldn't show me any shared calenders. fix that and this is a top app
Love it so far. Wish it had a widget for Android though.
"No doubt it’s the best productivity app. It is very smooth and customizable. I liked the idea of adding a Pomo Timer & Habit tracker. Having all this features made this app unique & amazing. But the prize of the premium package is little high, that's why i'm not gonna give you 5 Stars. Anyway, it’s a great app 🔥"
"Very Helpful, The Best Yet !"
"I dont like that it only works with calendar. i dont want a calendar even called ""sleep"" just to keep it on the graph"
Paid for it 2 times keeps wanting me to pay for it again
"Very good. Simple and easy to use. I would like to see more statistics, because for now I can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time, but not a overall statistics."
Never responded to my original review in 2019 and the response to my latest review still doesn't answer the fact that any tasks that are recurring DO NOT show in calendar even though you sync this information.
"A great app for making tasks. But, if you could add the alarm system and planning the schedule for free users, then it would be really nice...."
"Seems like a good idea but the widget is invisible. It is there, I can see the edges when I try to move it but it's completely invisible. I tried decreasing the widget transparency and deleting cache but to no avail. Devs, any clues? Thank you"
Please bring syncing with pc.
Ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
"beginning setup wasn't loading at all. signed up using Facebook. since it was not loading, i just clicked next. now I'm stuck with my Avatar with no way to change"
You can't even create an account without a purchase of the app. It costs $2.49 to make an account? EDIT: Thanks for replying
Best organizer out there. Easy to use and has an intuitive layout.
"I would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my Huawei p20, unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything, I tried removing the widget and re-doing it, now it doesn't even show my lists, and I have to go into the app to check or add things, which of course means once I'm done with the current ones I'll delete it. A task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful..."
"I would give this app 5 stars, but if you press ""silence notifications,"" you can never turn them back on."
Wonder full
"Kept crashing, rss feed if my calendar duplication of entries was HUGE and overall it just added to the noise rather than helping.. I'm out.. UPDATE: No I can't send a feedback (with log) as I've already unsubscribed and uninstalled the app.. and that's surely something you can add into functionality if you're really interested in gathering the data"
i cant set my times for events bc theres no am/pm option. it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing..annoying
"Sync doesn't work despite having a lifetime premium account, as others have said."
"sub tasks should be possible to leave unticked - for instance I might have put the bins out, but not replaced bin bags. on your apo, if I tick the main task, it assumes I have done the sub task."
The ios app is lot better than this. please improve it as soon as possible.
I Love how easy it is to navigate the app and all its features as well as being able to stay organized with multiple project on the go is made very easy now!
"This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ... Hence the 4 stars , connecting to a student service such as UniDays would increase influx of student users."
"I installed and then uninstalled it. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to edit day-by-day deviations from a routine. So I can set up a routine, but then have no way to track how well I followed it, day by day (for instance, exercised for half an hour instead of an hour, or started late, or missed it completely, or did things out of order). Am I missing something?"
"It would help me a lot if it could silence the notification from other apps 
when I'm studying"
"The best habit tracker app I've seen, would've done 5 stars, but I feel like something's missing, and I can't quite put my finger on it"
"Fine app. Would be perfect to have desktop web version also, to make adding routine much easier."
"I wanted to give the app more stars as I love the concept, but it's so buggy. Especially with the dailies feature... all the dailies are linked together somehow. There are some things I do Mon-Sat for instance, but not on Sundays. But when I set a task to not repeat on Sunday, it sets all tasks that way. Very frustrating."
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited."
"No matter what I do, even setting 'no notifications' when creating event or task; they  continually pop up. Not happy with this feature."
"This app works nice if you want to track daily or weekly tasks, but it was impossible for me to schedule tasks that should happen at a certain interval. For example, every two weeks, or every 5th of the month. There is the option to schedule a task a certain amount of times per month, but not to set specific intervals or dates for such occurrences. This was unfortunately a dealbreaker."
EDIT/UPDATE - Purchased premium. Sync doesn't work. A quick glance at developers FB/Twitter accounts shows that they have basically dropped off the face of the Earth (no activity since 2018). App hasn't received an update since 2018. My suggestion: pick an app that's still actively developed. Exactly what I have been looking for. Fantastic interface and thoughtful design. I'm hooked guys!
"I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!"
Unfortunately i can not sign up or sign in. By google account or email. I tried a lot. From iran
Great but basic in design and you cant not preview things such as sound. Its basic to use but some features are a little annoying like all the tags in one place. Id like the option to categorise.
Not able to buy plants. Unable to sign in.
"The app is pretty good, but I wish there was a way to put weekly tasks in. I tried setting up a task that would go off weekly but I still lost health for not completing it daily. It would be nice to be able to put repeating tasks on the app that you don't do every day, but repeat on a schedule, like laundry every Sunday or something."
"Navigation needs work: you can only navigate with the many buttons in the app, the back button closes the app. Feature request: Has weekly and monthly report, would like a daily report to share with an accountability partner Also, would be great to generate report based on category."
the free version is pretty minimal.
When I started using the app it was good .... But now it keeps on crashing and it says to delete the record/history and also right now I am trying to open it but thats not happening and I have to uninstall it and again install it..this has happenend with me for around 3-4 times.. Can anyone help?
Very disappointed that you have a very limited amount of habits and you require premium to be removed. I feel it should be lifted!
"I like this app very much to create a schedule for everyday and having the reminders. Haven't found any other app which perfectly fits my requirement like TimeTune. But I am always facing the issue where I stop receiving the intimation and have to ""Refresh background apps"" which is very annoying. Hope I can receive support for this issue."
It's assistance on screen seems to display the wrong resolution when using widgets
"Nice. Will be better if app has got inhabit counter.. for example count of pushups or exercise. I need it, but app is very nice. I will be recommend it."
"Overall i like this app and i am wondering if i should pay for the premium version, because there are serious limitations on the free one (no notes or labels)... But there is one thing that annoys me : the impossibly to control the view settings. It would be better if they had options to change the size of panels and size of fonts and smaller spacing between each entry. It would allow for a better overall view and/or permit to view more things at once and reduce wasted space of the left sidebar"
"The alarm sound doesn't work, so i could not know it already the time..."
"Only used for a day but it's the best app I've found for daily tasks / to do lists. Would love to see the following: 1. Completed tasks move to the bottom 2. Tasks be linked to a numerical value. 3. The ability to order each item manually, daily."
Liked wunderlist better
I loved this app when I used it 2 years ago but can I no longer log in?
"It's completely broken, things don't show up, error codes from the very beginning, it's just broken"
Improve my quality of concentration...
I'm a courier at a law firm and this ap is perfect for organizing deliveries.
"After installing the app, i check to see if my reacurring event would show up. And it did that one time. So minutes after i insalled i had to let it go."
Very easy to use the interface is very good and rookie
"Yeah i love this app. Inspired by the idea. Try planting a tree when you are havings stuffs to do, but you seem to be wasting time scrolling. That would be the real way of utilizing the app. And youve got different trees to grow :). Kudos to the creator."
"I had a 180 minutes timer and when I was about to give up I saw that ""0 tree's""🌲 will be dead.. hence I gave up, only to see 1 tree die.. I am really looking forward to not seeing this bug again. And also I was able to access my parallel space apps."
Impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist. Thank you for screwing my wunder-lists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password
"Very happy with Todoist after trying various. Easy to pick up and the nice widgets to display and quick add have very quickly become part of my routine, and stuck. Others have lacked smoothness in that area, best I've tried."
"i like how its organized and how many choices and the customization. but, i set alarms and keep in mind, i have all permissions on, and it didnt go on my screen, so i missed a very important meeting."
"At fırst it seems complicated, bu after some days you will find it handy and usefull"
"Seriously, this app is easy to use yet so useful. The workflow is smooth and user friendly, thumbs up."
"Simple and easy to use! The widget is fantastic and easy to read for a 50 year old trying to organize. No ads and free! I must say, i loaded at least 8 apps before i found this one and none of them compare. If you want an app that allows you to put tasks that you need to get done in an in your face format this is it!"
Great app but needs work.
"Honestly, one of the most brilliant apps to use if you need help focusing on work. You'll not regret using this app!!!"
It work absolutely fine but why every hour try to connect with Facebook servers? Adguard noticed it
"I can say this is a nice app! I often see this app on so many study videos. But i just start to use this app now and when i plant the tree, i can still open other apps and the tree didn't die...please help"
Godd
"fantastic app a critical flaw... one touch completion, now when you brush the screen your tasks get set to complete and you can't find them easily.. (updated July 25) the developer asked me to respond to comment... thanks for responding. don't fuss on my part ."
Love the way it can be easily zoomed for both size and number of days.
a very productive app. but mine kept crashing and I had to reinstall twice. couldn't keep up with progress.
Go overall application. I wish it was easier to make changes in already established recurring appointments and it would be nice to have a refresh button. Everything else works really well.
Good app
I try to write somthing and it exits
"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed..."
"I constantly get a message "" problem with the server "" please fix this, I liked the app a lot but I am unable to use it cause it doesn't connect nor update my tasks"
Full screen ads. 0/5 Edit : raised to 3/5.
Bad reviews are a real turn off for me.
So good
"This is a good planner because it's easy to use and understand, but the widget consumes a lot of the phone's battery."
"I kept getting empty screens when opening the app, so I pressed skip. Filled out the registry info and was taken to character creation where I couldn't see my character or the build options. I could select things like body or hair, but nothing appeared relating to that."
"Too complicated, wanted to use to strategize for my exam but it was to difficult to add a task."
Great app and the only flaw I see is that you can't yet export your data. Please make it so you can export data to something like pdf or something so I can save my entries forever
"I tested a few task apps, and this one looked promising at first. But very quickly I hit the paywall, even for basic and essential features such as reminders and labels. I'm going to use Trello instead."
I liked how I could customize everything but my linked google fit didnt update my steps (I had to input myself) and my notifications would only go off if I opened the app myself. Kind of defeats the purpose of linking and setting up notifications...
Terimakasih sudah membantu
"Linking tasks to higher level skills & characteristics, and then seeing them increase, is perfect motivation for me."
"I liked this app in its previous form, but they have been reducing options. One of my favorite thing was the repeat by minutes option. It's gone."
Stephen...can 2 people share a task list on their respective phones?
Good
"Worst app,, Now I just know that only 5 habit can track freely , there above premium, also payble Back up, But Developer are never inform first....."
"So disappointed to lose everything. I didn't realize the app didn't save your lists. Got a new phone and everything transferred but because this app doesn't have you log in, everything is gone. I had several important lists saved to prepare for my upcoming baby and it's all gone. I'll never remember it all. Time to look for something else to use. Response: From the main screen I didn't see any prompting so did not know I was supposed to or how to."
"You receive silent notifications or sometimes you don't even receive them and continue working on smth, which loses the reason you downloaded the app."
"The text on the notes always gets messy, specifically if you have spaces in between paragraphs or using links. Always gets messed up. Sentences move up and delete the first letters of the paragraphs. Really annoying."
"I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for. Unless I missed how/where to do them, there are three things I wish I could do in the app. First, create custom categories/subcategories, especially under health. Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes."
"Great UI, but there are concerns with adding tasks to my day page everyday is annoying and it would be helpful if it syncs with Google Calendar and includes tasks and reminders from it on the my day page."
"I was a customer of Any.Do for a while and on March 2020 i clearly asked them NOT to renew my subscription as i found a different company to provide me task manger services - Todoist. More than that - i even consult with Any.Do technical support team how to transfer my database to Todoist and over the phone, i ALSO remind them to cancel it. I received the cancellation notice and I DID NOT ask them to renew/continue any of Any.Do services. More than that - i also have the Invoice from the company i moved my services, Todoist, for the same period of time that Any.Do charged me for. After i tried to contact Any.Do they refused to refund me. Therefore, i let you and everybody to know that I WILL NOT USE ANY OF ANY.DO services anymore and recommend everyone that read this post DO NOT USE ANY.DO SERVICES or you taking a big risk that something like that will happen to you as well."
This is Demo Only
"Great app. I like how I can rearrange the list easily. Also the someday, upcoming and tomorrow categories are just what I need when something spring's to mind."
Is there any ways to see your progress in graphic? Like daily task you've done and see it in graphic stats or something? Because i can seems to find one in the apps or did i miss something? I wsnt to know and compare my tasks daily. The UI and everything is good tho except for that graphical stats daily i cant find one here dev
Wow this is what i was exactly looking for. Bought premium on the first day. Add many more features in the coming updates
"Tried it out. The time function, which is 90% of the app IMHO, is clunky. The default ""end"" time is ""until next activity"", but then it automatically changes to the start time of the next activity and you can't change it back. Then, if you add a task that overlaps other start times, it deletes the other activities. I spent 15 minutes setting up a schedule and was frustrated to find that I had erased my entire afternoon schedule because I made a mistake when changing the end time of something mid-day. This app was, for me, ironically, a waste of time."
Very helpful in staying focused on a work. I mainly use this during studying to stay focused and to track the amount of time I have spend. Is a wonderful app.
"Paid premium, it doesn't sync at all. Costumer service unresponsive for a long time. Don't spend money on Premium, this app is dead, the last update was in 2018"
Everything is a premium feature. Everything else is a basic list
"This app seems great. i've seen other apps gamifying your life, but what i feels really works, is that you can make a party of friends, and get productive together, while clearing dungeons and getting loot. if you make a group of friends, be aware that even if its just your friends in the group, a single swearword will get you banned. not a warning or anything, straight up banned. i got banned because i called my close friend a F-word C-word. mind you not in public, but in our little group, where that sort of banther is normal between us. Mind you, i'd never talk to anyone like that in a public group. i don't mind policing the language of users if they are abusive or using foul language like that in public, but to me its a bit much to ban people for a private conversation, where there was no victims, but its not within my power to change the community guidelines. hopefully i'll get unbanned so i can give the app a swing. it does seem great. only 3 stars for being so quick to jump the ban hammer. will definetly change stars for the better, if the community guidelines loosen up in regards to private conversations and partys. maybe add a report button instead?"
I really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs. The first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too. After updating the app it was still the same. (Im using a samsung s8 if thats important) Hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app.
"The recent update has changed everything I liked about this app. In my ""task"" view I manually have to select overdue/today/tomorrow/this week in order to see the corresponding tasks. In the previous version I had the ability to see all of them and hide the tasks which weren't relevant. I should be able to see multiple lists at the same time, and this filter just doesn't let me. I want to see my ""overdue"" and ""today's"" planned task in one view. That's the most important for me."
It's hard to understand how it works
This app is amazing
I loved the app so much . It is amazing and helps me a lot organize my ideas.. I think if it had the option to put our tasks in order and the option of setting timer it would be very organized and irreplaceable.
It worked perfectly for me and benefits me with fantastic pleasures!!
There are full-size ads that block your entire screen. Incredibly disruptive and I don't want to reward that by buying pro. There are other calendar apps out there that don't deliberately disrupt your productivity.
"Limited use so far, every time I i touch the calendar icon the app changes to calendar but will not revert back to watch face unless i uninstall and reinstall no back button"
"This is fun and cool it would be 5 stars but you know what habitica WE DIE SO QUICKLY WE LITTERALLY LOG IN (ME AND MY PARTY) AND WE ARE DEAD BECAUSE SOMEONE DIDNT LOG IN THAT DAY, ALSO THERE SHOULD NOT BE BOSS DEALING DAMAGE IT DEALS MORE DAMAGE THEN I DEAL TO IT, THE HEALERS HEAL 6 HEALTH OUT OF 50 AND USE 25 MANA POINTS MY TEAMATE JUST USED ALL OF THEIR MANA TO TRY AND KEEP ALIVE AND I DO THEN I CHECK OFF MY DAILIES FROM YESTERDAY AND I DIED AND I DEALT 11 BOSS DEALT 14 PLS FIX TEAM AGREES FIX"
"Looks like it's not supported anymore. Shame. I used it for about a year and really liked it. Edit - looks like it works again, no idea when it stopped being broken as no dev ever responded to my inquiries about the malfunctions. Four stars because I liked it while I used it but I have found something better (Loop). Instead of once ""per week"" you can set a goal of once per # of days. Works better for me, and is more useful."
It would be great if the notifications actually works!! I don't get notified by any task I put in at all
"This is the app I've been looking for but there's still room for improvement. First off, when setting the default notification to x amount of minutes before, it would make most sense to also have a notification the moment it actually happens, or at least have the option to do so without having to do it manually for every single entry. Second there is a lack of flexibility. There should be a way to easily move around and resize items on your schedule without changing the routines themselves."
I was using this app for years and I'm used to it but those ads are so annoying. It's sad for me to look for other options. You should leave those ads out
If you like a simple app to get the job done...this is it.
Very effective!
Add seamless integration for office 365 accounts..
Doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore. No way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar
This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time)
"Great app that now has intrusive full screen ads, ugh"
Anything beyond keeping a simple list (including reminders) is paid
Works very well for me. Very helpful because I can see what I prioritized for work and for my business days before.
"Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme."
"This is my first time rating this app because I noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder. Hopefully after the task tab, the time & date will be under it. It's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses I didn't notice it for several times. Also,I don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people ;so it should not be the priority. I hope that you can do something about this. Anyway, thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks.I'll wait for another update"
Fix permissions for 5 stars. Great design and UI but you shouldn't need access to my contacts to login with my Google account. Google provides an API for it that all other apps use without contacts permissions.
Pretty good overall. Notifications and reminders do not work most of the time.
"limits habits to like 6 or whatever unless you pay, useless"
Gd
I don’t know why it missed some alarm. UI design is great. But i missed some imp task cause of this missed alarm prob
"I really liked the app but suddenly from nowhere all of my data were gone. One second they were fine then when I connect to the internet, it's back at lvl 0 with the Johnny avatar.  It seemed that there was no way to get my data back. Dropbox saved data seemed to have been overwritten so idk what to do. I feel betrayed being immersed in the apo then suddenly left hanging with the fact that I don't even know what caused it."
"Aww man glad I found this!!! Love rpg games and this is a great incentive to get stuff done, just wish the full version wasn't almost 60 bucks or a subscription fee... Lil much for a reminder app"
This is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me. I found a free app that does tbe same things.
"I gave it a lower rating because lately if I had any repeat scheduled appointments, I can't change one without changing them all. Very aggravating. Before, I was able to cancel one without affecting all the future repeat weekly or monthly entries. Before, I could use this calendar to keep track of my past activities. Now it looks like I attended a meeting when I didn't because I couldn't cancel it without affecting future meetings"
I will reinstall this app
"It ok, gets boring after a while"
Ease of use. Everything at your fingertips. Even I can't forget something.
"Why on earth would you create an app that doesn't link with your calendar??? The To Do app is straightforward on Android app and desktop version. HOWEVER, there's no way to link it to Microsoft 365 Calendar! It's within the same suite of Microsoft 365 and yet, you can't schedule on either one to show up on the other. That's asinine! ! You would think this would be a primary feature, but the Product Manager must be sleep at the wheel. It's mystifying."
"Not able to get rewards in rewarded ad . Also the app gets crashed every alternate day , have to reinstall and log in every single time"
"Awesome habit tracker, I like that you can go back in time to track a habit you've already started."
"Worked great at first but continously does not sync completely with Alexa. I only use this app as a shopping list with Alexa, but when it only shows 4 of 10 items on my list it's pretty useless. The purpose of the list is so that I don't have to remember the 10 items I told Alexa to add to the list (which show up on todoist)"
"Hello! Your app is amazing! My GF and me installed this app 2 days ago and started to planning task to each other. But i really need a list functional, like add a shopping list or some book list to add in this app. Are you going to add this? Sry for my English, btw:) UPDATE: And i really need a functional to add a checklist in tasks with possibility to mark it's completed. Thank you and your team again for this great app!"
"love the app,any chance we'll be getting an iOS version of it too? and be able to sync everything across all devices (maybe even a desktop version of the app)"
"Idk what happened, but from the start app was just alright, and it was very nice and I was happy that i found it. But since a few hours it just stopped working! When I'm trying to complete the task it just doesn't count. The mark is appears, but several seconds later it vanishes!!! And also when I'm trying to complete a part of assignment it doesn't count. Please fix :("
🖤IT
"I wish it had a widget, but I love it otherwise."
"Love the program and it's definitely an improvement over Google Calendar. Just the easy moving back and forth between dates using the 'go to' feature is a huge plus in my book. It does have some short comings that are irritating to me at least. I use my calendar to keep track of my to do lists. I save them in the Description field. First off the editing features such as bolding, underlining, line numbering, etc don't appear anywhere unless like in my case you accidently discover them by doing a"
Always a good thing! Great! Wonderful!
"Truly dark mode is needed (amoled) (when I open a task, the ""dark theme"" is gray. Not black FULLY BLACK)."
Great reminder for me! Love it
"If you want something that syncs to your calendar, you are in luck! It really is beautiful and such a wonderful idea. However my 3 star review comes from the fact you can't use it without syncing to your calendar, and there by having it affect your calendar. I was hoping to use this as an hourly time management tool, much like a block system, but I can't have it be that AND have my calendar be a place for just appointments. It makes the actual calendar look too full and messy. Basically in short, can you please add an offline tool as well?"
start crashing right after 2 days..but the idea is good
"it's better to have biweekly schedule. Im using this app to manage my to do list, unfortunately, it doesnt have every other week schedule or biweekly schedule. to be honest i have lot of things to do during that schedule because my oayout is every other week so i really need to have that kind of schedule. olease add that up. thank you."
just installed Love that syncs with google. Wish the mobile app allowed Screen rotation. Wish I could Zoom on the week a month view. I understand mobile i in beta. Looking forward to the evolution.
"Best app ever, haha"
"One week of use & I purchased a subscription. I've used other similar apps, I enjoy this the most. There a few improvements needed, so I need to add suggestions to the Reddit page. I spent time & wrote out what I value in life, what my aspirations are, & then I narrowed down a few simple goals to reach those aspirations. Then I added my goals to this app. So far it's easy to keep track of my goals, habits, & how I'm doing. It's incredibly easy & even fun to use. Thank you for this app."
"The tracker itself is not bad but I set up a notification to remind me to do something and am not getting them. I already checked my settings, all is good. It's nice if you remember to go in and mark done but notifications are not working."
"It's a good app, no question about it but it's not perfect. I used it for months after abandoning todoist but I'm leaving Ticktick now. It's feature packed but not as polished as other products. The UI is not great and the app has very different design language as well as features depending on which device you open it on. This lack of consistency as well as poor natural language support doesn't make it the perfect ToDo app."
"I used this app a few times, but now, Facebook login won't work. It'd be a better app if you could just sync it with your Google account."
You literally have to buy premium for it to remind you. Like that defies the purpose of the app. Just go use Tick Tick instead. Its free version has more features than this Todoist's premium version.
"Setting up late events (past 11pm) is literally impossible. Start and end times/days will shift randomly when I make a change to the other.  Whenever I do manage to get both right, I get a ""Same time"" error even though clearly the start and end times are different."
"I downloaded this app on my photo and it works great! But I just downloaded on my tablet for school and even though I used the same account, none of my events were there. It didnt sync right. I tried to restart, nothing. This app is good, just not for multiple devices."
"Ok concept, but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level. Kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of AI with suggestions for every parameter, and sync between different devices, to get the basic functionality into usable state."
Please add archiving for stagnant dailies
"To be honest, it's a really good app. It has everything (simplicity, system, ui, etc.) but seriously, if this is really a productivity app, it needs to have an offline mode. Does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list?"
"Too complicated. It probably has a lot of, but it's not intuitive enough."
It was amazing! I just didn't have the time to set it up all the way.
The motivational messages are annoying. You can only track up to 5 habits in the free version but it is totally not worth paying for more. Good riddance. I suppo this kind of app is just not for me.
"edit : something more important, please don't make the user logged out after using vpn, it's a pain to log in every time this app is great, but please add the copy list feature on android too, and also ""uncheck all"" feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one"
"I like the app but there is one thing that annoys the hell out of me. I use a number of sublists for shopping. Whenever the screen changes orientation or Auto rotates the app defaults back to the first sub list and I have to reopen the one I was working with. Very annoying. Update; My opinion of the app is unchanged, but snarky respones from the developer are uncalled for. I get it, it's free, and I'm not using a lower end device. Maybe find a new hobby if you don't like comments."
"Very nice app for productivity. My favorite feature is that tasks and dailies that are finished can he hidden. However, it requires connection too much. Wouldn't mind syncing from time to time but I'd really hope there could be a way to tick off tasks even offline. Also would love to see ""weeklies"" or something that doesn't reset everyday for goals like ""go to gym 3x this week"" or ""walk dogs 5x this week"". Integration of calendar events would also be nice."
Straight forward. I like the widgets on this and makes it easy to check in on what you need to do for the day. The scheduling is also very helpful because you can have tasks that are intermittent or habits that are intermittent on a regular schedule. It's also nice to be able to have a goal as a number or just a yes or no did you do it or not. And the statistics are nice because you can look back and see how consistent you've been with something and that will remind you to buckle down.
It's an okay app but I have found better ones such as I am sober. This needs to be paid for to be useful.
Generally very good. I have a few problems when I use it for reminders. working out what I need to write for a week of reminders in 10 days time is a bit challenging.
Please make the reminder work!!! It's really important for me to remember things because I forget and don't do it in the end.
"This app is great and it already helping me stay on track with some things. It's surprising how much imaginary experience points can motivate. But, I am having a bug where dailies can't be set for a given day, they just revert to all days being checked. I want this app to keep me accountable for working out on certain days, so this is a major flaw."
"I've been using it for a couple of years & it's worked well for me. I like being able to set reminders on tasks, something GTasks doesn't do by itself. I did spring for the paid version since i use it pretty heavily and to get the all-in-one widget. Worth it!"
"Fantastic app, simple and easy to use"
"I love it. I'm like playing a game w/o using my phone but if you think about it, I'm actually playing a game using my phone!"
"I didn't get it, but I don't know I'm the demographic it was made for."
"Been using it for a while. At first, i didnt like it as much, but then I played with the settings and was able to change what I didnt. I use it everyday to plan my day ahead. It's been way better than just having a running list in my notes. It saves your tasks so you can cross them out when you're finished but if its something you do regularly like laundry or something, you can just tap it to move it back to the top. Also allows subtasks. Def helps keep me organized. What I was looking for!"
has potential but the interface isnt user friendly at all
Turn life into a game! Create your own tasks and assign value to them! Pretty cool eh?
Great app. I would rate it a 5 but there's an error where my completed tasks becomes unchecked constantly causing it to keep on becoming an unfinished task and it's annoying.
"A minimalistic task management and scheduling app with an beautiful interface and great widgets as well and packs a punch in terms of free features. Any.do does not allow sublists and allows only one level of subtasks to ensure simplicity, but compromising power. I have also found it quite cumbersome to add a task, put it into the right list and add a label to it. This is a long drawn out process which takes so much time and completely ruins the rest of the simplicity the app has."
The app crashes very often. You also have to restart the app every time for a reward to show up in your inventory.
The app is crashing always if I open the store of new trees in the latest update.
"I'm very sorry I bought the full version so quickly. The only benefit I found so far, is the ability to add more than 7 habits. I couldn't find a report that would provide information about my success and pinpoint areas that I seem to regularly miss. I was drawn to the simple UI but will probably write this off as a waste of money and return to Daily Tasks."
"I've used this calendar for years. It has always been the best. But now they've added ads. Unless those go away, I'll be finding a new calendar."
Nice configuration settings. Able to set most goals. One setting that I couldn't get to work for me was trying to get a goal for every other day. It seemed to that the goal needed to be completed every second day and comoleting it on off days didn't work. The UI is slightly un-intuitive as well. I don't think swiping up on a goal calendar should swap to another goal. It makes it hard to scroll down to the community form at the bottom if the app.
"No Resent Updates, no Local Backup Option. Other than that it's Good."
"This is app is perfect just need a checklist and daily, weekly and monthly tracker for each task... Had it been have all these, I would have given all 5 stars! You know sometimes we miss(or intentionally ignore) reminders and we need trackers for those for self development!"
I like the Apple task app way better.
"## You ""reaching out"" has not, in any way, addressed the question I asked, I'll uninstall. Thanks anyway. ## * Rather disingenuous response. When doing a local backup it informs the user that Manual backup ""will be removed in a future version"". Why would I continue using it if I will not be able to to do a local back up my data at some point ""in the future"" ? * I don't use the ""cloud"" so this will be useless to me if I can't backup locally."
"Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary. But the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1, 5 or 15 minute chunks is great, and the programmer feature works well as always, particularly good for planning out studies and work."
"Clunky, complicated, and confusing. Not streamlined. Ugly color choice for non pro. Just a disappointment."
"Needs more customization. Also, please somehow merge/connect to-do with sticky notes."
"Very nice UI, but need some work. 1) First week day (Monday/Sunday) option in Calendar; 2) Calendar should show tasks/habits below Calendar instead of when touching the selected day only (this makes you feel you have nothing the whole day/mont)... Add this and app will be more solid... And I may jump into Premium! Keep it up!"
"This is by far the most useful and customisable Gamify your life app. It also focuses on skills and character building, which is my favorite part and mostly missing with comparable apps. Takes a bit to get into it, but it's definitely worth it :D"
If hide the app its not working. Not sign out.
"For anyone with Adhd, this app is like hitting the jackpot! Simple (can't over complicate things) but very powerful. The 'Focus' function allows me to prevent distractions on my phone and see what I was working on if I am distracted hy something else, keeping me in task. It's ability to integrate/sync with almost anything allows me to add a task or event to whatever is immediately available before I forget. Only suggestion is ability to add contact to events/tasks."
timezone feature broken. the gamification was a little too complicated and too much for my needs.
"Very nice, very simple, very usefull, but the free mode is too annoyingly limited. looking forward to having the ability to link habits with my wife or friends."
Loved it..... It's the best app ever for scheduling and time management ♥️♥️♥️
It would be a 5* review if it weren't yearly payment. Put it a one time payment and I'll be the first one to buy it. This really ruined it for me.
"All free, unobtrusive advertisements, easy to use and tonnes of categories you can make yourself too."
"Great app, but needs to be able to switch accounts easily. I have an account for personal life, and work life. On my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist."
"Didn't realize this synced to my outlook calendar, started deleting work stuff and deleted two important appointments from my work calender. I'm screwed on those, was planning on using this for personal use only."
"It's terrific. So flexible. So organized. Wish it had a web app, but that is the only drawback."
"Increase my productivity, helps me to remind, and also the price for premium version is also very less."
"Serve it's purpose, but it can be run in background which should be neglect the whole Idea of note using Phone when focusing on other things"
Very good aap
"I'm using this app for quite some time, it has big problems which forcing me look for another app, it doesn't remind me on time, all the reminders work when I open this app at that time it was too late.. What the use having this app.. Please correct this problem or else I am happy the all the options and features.. Thank you"
Claims syncing but it always fails to sync. Lost all data when got new phone. Donwgrading to two stars.
I don't know how to use it .. Help me please 🙏🏻
Edit to reply: You never used to need all these dodgy permissions. What changed? Why do you need to read my notifications now? Update: used to love this app. Now it needs a bunch of sketchy new permissions to do the same job it used to do: keep you from using your phone. So so disappointing as now I have to let the app read all my notifications (????) or it becomes useless.
I love how simple this app is. I am able to track my habits and actually make meaningful changes in my life.
I can't sign in to my account
Quite good one but I prefer single purchase option. But seriously I like the statistics. Well I saw it automatically logs out and not doing backup.
Unable to create an account despite using email or social media account. Can't even start trying out the app
the app and widɡet are very ɡood. Will change to 5 start when I can be able to add task using google assistant.
Perfect for what I do
在我学习上虽然有很大的帮助，但是我使用专业版很常跳出来进不了应用(之前不用专业版还挺顺的)希望官方能够在这方面修复，那它对我来讲就是最喜欢用的计时app☺ *edited 我登入了我的账号后按进去app的时候一片白然后就跳出来了当我清空回初使用时或者删除重新下载就没有问题 手机型号 vivo v7+ VER4.18.0#438
"I've been using this app for at least 4 or 5 years now (when it was Wunderlist and now as Microsoft To Do). I use it constantly for weekly lists, groceries, and it has been wonderful for keeping track of odds and ends over time like books I want to read, music to listen to, etc. I like that you can attach documents. Only downside is I wish I could customize it more with different color schemes. Overall, very user-friendly."
Strong fallout/ skyrim feel. But full buy price is 45$? Even those games' price are lower on sale. And I bought them on sale. Other sold apps price are usually below 5 dollars. And the default free theme has nice green background but paid ones only have bright white background?? I don't sub apps I buy them.Sub is for something like Netflix and Spotify...
Reminder popups are not displaying at the bottom of my screen on my new Samsung Galaxy S20 Ultra. They only appear in the notification area at the top of screen. Is this an Android 10 issue? How do I get the popups again? It worked fine on my Samsung Galaxy S8+
"It is a great app. But still there is space for some improvement. The calendar for example: you have one to add more tasks, other to see each specific task and the days that you did the job, but note one to see the sum of all tasks. You should create a resume calendar, where I can see the percentage of jobs that I accomplished in each day."
Notification features should be free.
"This is just a re-skinned Samsung calendar, don't waste your time"
Hyper masculine tone is very off-putting and irritating. Hint to developers: Women try to change habits too! At least give us the option of just having hints in our own words...
"Displaying the ""Contacts"" calendar of every Google account cannot be deactivated in Calendar & Tasks list (it re-activates immediately)."
Not Working On Xperia E1!
"In order to actually use the app as a planner, you have to pay money. Very misleading and dissapointing."
"I am using the paid version and this is really good, love it. Quick question...I want to integrate this with the Samsung smart watch. Is this possible, otherwise deserves 5 stars. Please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender Account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors."
"Poor settings options. I tried to set a schedule for an entire day to be more productive. Kept getting emails for each task at the time I scheduled it. I also got notification pop-ups on my MacBook calendar app which seemed to sync itself with my Google calendar. I went to Google calendar to turn it off but it wouldn't let me. I had to delete all 10 emails, hide the notifications and now I will be uninstall this app. It should have an option to disable syncing. Nice idea. Lazy developers."
Very nice
"Used to be great app. Now sucks, unpredictable syncing and other day not syncing Google calendar on Android 10."
This has been a pretty indispensable tool for me. It motivates me to do the tasks that sometimes I would really rather not do like put in eye drops or exercise. My personality requires checklists or I'll find excuses to skip doing things.
"Worst app for reminder, period. Use google products instead. They will work no matter if you turn on or off the background use. This power hungry good for nothing apps are straight to be ruled out. Well if you don't believe me, give it a try and keep regretting"
ItS pretty good.
Подписка на полгода пропала сразу же после переустановки приложения.
Got a new tablet which sync my notes fine after I uninstalled and signed back in. My new phone won't sync. On the app for my phone there is no place to sign out! Frustrating
"I had thought this was wonderful. Not perfect, but definitely 4 1/2 stars. Recently, it's begun messing with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 System UI, that must be force closed in order to move on. I've turned notifications off, which defeats most of the purpose, but am still using the app. If I'm able to determine that it wasn't this app, I'll update my review."
"A decent app, but for me, it's not worth paying £15/yr for, and that's at 50% off. £30 is just ridiculous for a to-do/calender app. There are other task/calender apps, just as good and free."
"Overall its good but this new version is not working when i open store, app gets close automatically"
Great app 👍 could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list.
Still the best calendar app I've found. Nothing beats the month view and customizability. Can group calendars to display or hide as suits your needs.
"I love writing notes and to do lists. But this program does not save. I mean, when you write notes in the middle of writing and try forceful close (what happens, if phone crashes in the middle?) and doesn't automatically save. So I'm not really sure, if I want to use it, because I'm afraid I'm going to get lost a lot of my progress. I would like to use it. But for now I will rather have to wait or find another alternative."
"I used to love this app. It has great widgets and interface. However, about a month ago, it stopped syncing my work events and now they won't even appear. Turns out the account was removed. I re-entered the info and nothing came back."
"Assigning task is a problem and not available, the reminder is also wanting"
Reminders should be available for all.
"If only this app would allow integration with Google Calendar and Todoist. I really like the promodoro timer feature of this app and wanted to use it for my tasks in Todoist. Although this app allows subscription to local calendar, you cannot use promo timer with calendar tasks. Please allow integration with other apps."
I paid for the premium version but all my habits records was deleted without explanation. They fix that problem.
Thanks for the response to the developer you guys are great. I hope I can make better feedback in future
"It does everything that my old task app used to do (wunderlist) but has some additional functionality which annoys me. There's a ""My day"" page which, I like as a concept, but it doesn't link to the tasks I've planned for ""today"". If I want today's tasks to appear there, I have to open the task and add it to ""my day"" which seems like a waste of time. I'd ignore that functionality entirely but it's the very first item on the app menu and it just annoys me being there not reflecting my actual day."
It's kinda cool but the alarm icon disappear immediately the app is closed and therefore do not show notification when the time set is due.
"My personal experience with the app makes me say this is deforme designed more as a task management app than a habit tracking app. The two things I want to do when building a new habit are 1) easily enter the stats for the habits I'm tracking and 2) see the timeline of the habit growth in a snapshot or as a dashboard. This app focuses on ""today's tasks"", so getting to the specific habits, entering information for another day and charting progress are too cumbersome."
i think I could really like this app. except I upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes. It will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search...
This app helps me many times and really it works as noone wanna cut its tree and we just do till time over ........ Totally it is nice ......god job
"I use the paid version, and the 24 dial is magnificent and very useful to visualize your whole day. But I need to view this on my Samsung watch. How to do so? provided that o see a Smart watch options in the settings."
I have a couple of requests if you don't mind. 1. Contexts/Tags; to further organise tasks into different categories. Kindly give us the option of creating our own contexts or tags as well. 2. The percentage completion tracker for nested tasks through a dashed line is pretty ingenious. Kindly add a numerical tracker at the end of the dashed line as well which shows the percentage completion numerically. Thank you! Shahnawaz
"This is my first time rating this app because I noticed that there were changes in putting a reminder. Hopefully after the task tab, the time & date will be under it. It's a bit hassle that it was made smaller that without my glasses I didn't notice it for several times. Also,I don't see any purpose of sharing it to other people ;so it should not be the priority. I hope that you can do something about this. Anyway, thank you for helping me get through my daily tasks.I'll wait for another update"
"I enjoy the app very much and it's helping me kick some bad habits. The only thing I'm not a big fan of is that it often times does not auto refresh after clicking an item or useing food. Other than that, I like the app a lot."
It's a pretty good app and most important aspect it has is the ability to keep track of a habit. It's pretty simple how it is done. Also you can look back at the apps's calendar and see the days that you did follow that habit.
"I love this app. There could only be one checklist option, it would be perfect! ❤️"
There's this weird bug now where the screen dims and keeps showing the loading sign but you can still use the buttons. Please fix it!
I have tried so many apps but i completely satisfied with only this app.because the font sizes are larger and visually feels good this is really very useful to make what i want so i want to get premium or platinum before that the developer need to solve the drawbacks that is transfering data one mobile to another and clear the different features about platinum
"The app is a great tool for tracking goals, which can keep you motivated to continue good habits, or stop bad habits."
"The app is excellent; simple, streamlined, functional to-do list. However, the newly redesigned widget gives me a heck of a lot _less_ control. How do I select and reschedule a group of tasks? How do I open the app from the widget (so I don't need both the widget and an icon)? If I wanted to do complex editing, I could easily open the app, and the widget could do things the app couldn't. Give it back!"
soo bugy
nice but no daily notification come
"This app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do. The Quick post function is great. However, unlike other similar apps, this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen. So for me, that is really unfortunate. If this changes, I will gladly give this a perfect rating."
"Great app, very easy to use. Calendar view is amazing!"
"Nice idea with a few issues: some tasks never seem to go away. Whether I say I did them or fail or skip or try to edit they always stay there for the same day. Also, if I miss one day it takes forever going through each missed task and either skipping or failing or deleting or whatever. And like I said sometimes that doesn't work. Fix these issues and I could really get behind using this app."
Good
Changing from wunderlist I was concerned it wouldn't be as good. I'm increasingly appreciating this app. Seems big improvements were made to it to reflect some of wunderlist best features. Thanks for the work put in to achieve this.
not really the app that I was looking for but ok
I don't get this app
"This app has a lot of potential, but a few things could be added, and tweaked. I recommend adding a calender, and more icon options."
2020-07-03 update: ticktick seems to have added kanban view to mobile app and I am weirdly thrilled by this. This is the best cleanest Todo list app I've been able to find. Got my partner on and now we have a fully synchronized grocery shopping list. I live my life by my various lists on here and it's fantastic. Thanks team
"I love the idea of this app, is quite unique in the way it visually shows 
my upcoming events. Sadly, try as I might, I can't get it to refresh 
correctly with my calendar, its always wing despite following all the steps."
"I used to have this as my default watch face, but lately I can't put this on my Android Wear device. Maybe my Ticwatch is too old for the latest version, but it used to be the best. Does anyone know how to put this watchface on their Android Wear if it doesn't show up automatically?"
Free version too much limited.
I really liked the app but now I'm going to have to find something else. They have started to have pop up ads that are very disruptive. I was in a meeting and I had to put in an event in the calendar when an ad popped up and started blaring music and I couldn't close it until the ad was finished. It was very inappropriate. It is now totally unsuitable for a business calendar with these ads. I was fine before when the ads were unobtrusive.
I'm really enjoying the fun parts about this game and hope that it continues to grow. Downside is the glasses and headband can't come off the avatar. So my character is stuck with them for awhile.
"Was looking for a replacement for Wunderlist, and found this app. Looked like a great alternative to Wunderlist. Installed the app, and started to setup bill reminders, only to find that, thre primary reason fir a To Do app is reminders, is only available for $36/year. REALLY?! NO THANK YOU!"
Force feeds users with video ads after each entry.
"Excellent app, they greatly improved the quality since last time I used it. I'm a user of the web page for 5 year now, and the app was a little outdated but know it is very complete and useful. Thank you!"
This is only to add your todo list and thats all tou can do with the free if you want to put date and time to let you know you have to do somthing. You pay not good at all With free versions drom other apps do the same this pay app
Wunderlist was better. It at least let you move items in the order you prefer. You would think Changing the date would organize it in that manner but no. It stays in the order in which it was assigned which means you have to scroll a lot more than necessary
"wish the reminder have had a repeat function(e.g. every week), so I don't have to recheck the tasks"
"I have been waiting for a promised refund since 25th June, have sent several emails. Would appreciate my refund"
What happened to the repetition option? It disappeared with the last update! Edit: I uninstalled & reinstalled & that fixed it.
Good
"Updating to 4 stars because push notifications are now live.. Not Fully Developed. This app could be great, but in their rush to put it out, the features are highly lacking. No push notifications, you cannot upload stickers, no widget, pretty buggy. I really liked the idea of it, but it needs improvement. I will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added. They did reach out to me to resolve my issues, so I am updating to three stars."
"Great concept. But I didn't build up coins quickly enough, and didn't get any gems, meaning I couldn't get anything new for my character. Honestly, a calendar and check-mark system would give me more incentive than this."
"Helps me stop touching my phone It helps me stop touching my phone. However, there is not much thrill in planting the tree. You cannot select where the tree is going to grow, and eventhough there are number of other trees, it cost so much and earn so little from planting it makes it so boring. It can get quite dissapointing"
Why this  require this much personal details?
"It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them."
Hmm... I like it
It's such a bummer it doesn't work on the Samsung sport watch.
Simple and effective. Especially love using the widget.
"Meh, it integrates with everything else 365 and I'm kind of stuck in their web currently. It's a little too simplistic, I know a lot of people that have stuck with OneNote for their To Do items if staying within 365 realm. Google Tasks and Keep work much better. To Do does have a lot of potential but it's needs to be more robust without overcomplicating it. I'm still working on it but realizing that while their Automation seems cool, that it's just doing for me what Google has done for years."
Great app but it never archived old chores so didne let points
Simply fantastic and user friendly.
"Can't choose notification tone, has to share the sms tone which is confusing"
someone created a time productivity app that takes too much time out of your day to understand it.
"I've just installed this app and will definitely play with it in the next few weeks. It really looks nice and really structured! So far my only surprise is that there's no female icon for the person. Only nuns or dancers, but not a simple female icon that doesn't do anything - just stands. Hello, is this app exclusively for men or is the icon hidden somewhere?"
not really an exciting app
"This app could be five stars to me. what is stopping me is the confusion on knowing just what tasks to do or not to do. There's a confusing list of tasks that show up at the bottom and if I did not do them the day before or not click them, they just show up there. If I delete a task from the calendar on accident what do I do? the calendar should be completely removed cuz it's worthless. I think tasks should have some sort of streak function or show how many times you have done it in a row."
"Super buggy on Android, have to close and open constantly for anything to work."
"Hi. Long time TickTick user. Unfortunately the app still has big issues with subscribed LOCAL calendars. Recurring events from the local calendar are doubled in the list view and have been for a long time now. The last time it worked properly was in 5.2.1. I notified you guys a long time ago, but it hasn't been fixed. I finally tried Any.Do and it works properly with my LOCAL calendar so it seems that I will be giving them my subscription money this year."
Very good but should they really charge money for a to do list app?
"It's not clear how much it cost the premium account. Also, every time I try to go premium I get a message saying ""the in-app billing are not available on this device"". I've always do in-app purchasing and it was the first time that I got this issue. Really disappointed."
I can't use it because I must to pay and be premium that rude 😒.
"Simple design, clean UI, useful for use as GTD and also very powerful when using its filters. The best IMHO."
"Using the free version and it's easy, intuitive, and highly flexible...It reflects just what I want to track for five different tasks each week (from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where I log time spent on these actions and notes too!) I've already recommended it."
I really like this calendar. It syncs well with my Google accounts - better than other 3rd party calendar apps I've tried. (I've only used the free version)
"nice, but there seems to be no way to hide declined events? that makes it much less useful. Would give 5/5 otherwise"
"I wanted to try the app but it never opens. I can't even sign up or sign in, tapping anything doesn't work. Tried uninstalling and reinstalling, still the same. With this i stopped trying the app in a week, and opened it again today, updated the app, and still nothing can be clicked from the homepage. Idk if it's just my phone but my other apps are perfectly working and i never had this type of issue before"
The app was working fine until I removed Google Now. Now the widgets will not show on home page.
"Good idea for an app, but I uninstalled due to overcomplicated interface. For example, there are 2 ""+"" symbols, neither of which are self-explanatory (is it for a sub list of main list or another sub list category. I'd prefer there to be words there to explain what they mean and, additionally, a description of what list you're working under after you enter a list. I need an app that's unobtrusive but yet daily I can easily view my to do lists and subgoals."
"I would have loved it if not for the fact that there is a problem with the widget on my Huawei p20, unfortunately it gets stuck often and cannot click anything, I tried removing the widget and re-doing it, now it doesn't even show my lists, and I have to go into the app to check or add things, which of course means once I'm done with the current ones I'll delete it. A task app with no immediate access on main screen is not too helpful..."
Can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee.
Been using this for over a year. Customizeable enough for the free version + no annoying bits. 10/10
I HATE HATE HATE how the My Day feature works. Totally different than Wunderlist and completely breaks my (and many others') workflow. Uninstalled.
Not user-friendly
Simple yet perfectly helping me achieve my goals
Easy to use and no more forget events with friends and customers anymore.
"Hi , i use this app to manage my studying And it works very nice But if it had a calendar it would be excellent If you can , please add a nice calendar to the app, that it shows our tasks too  Thanks for your amazing app"
For me is One of the best ways to do stuff and feel like it has some sort of meaning.
"I was recommended this app by a friend who loves it. I got the premium version as I expected it to have better features. This app is very confusing to use. I even went to the ""help"" section and was even more confused. I'm very disappointed"
"Horrible marketing adds every time, removing the app."

"I like the app, very helpful for lots of things, however I've lost my account twice. I've had to uninstall it and recreate my account. Very good otherwise tho"
Would not load
Basic features like comments and tags are behind a subscription wall
Very lovely app. Timer + statistics + it's beautiful. Don't care much about else. It just works
"I just love it, simple, cool and very efficient!"
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.
Love it except I can't change the positive memes at the bottom anymore.
Has potential but i need it for the programer which costs money
"Previously good, currently bad. This app takes you straight to Google calendarfor creating an event but once the event has been set, it's on calendar only. It doesn't even show that any event has been set on the app itself. I was using this app as sort of a time table but if I'm not able to see my plans for the day, then what's the use. Pls fix it"
I can't get new password. It sends message: email is not available.
"Really Impressed..! I was really looking for something like this. Thanks to the Team 👍 But, I wish the pro version price was a bit low then I would really buy the pro version too."
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.
Awesome app TBH.. seriously helped me a lot through my studies my daily routines to have time management in my life.. Kudos to Time tune app seriously very rarely you stumble upon a app Soo useful
"Love the way they keep updating new species of tree , keeps u motivated and kind of provides satisfaction at the end of the day ,"
"My rating is just based on my needs. The app says it has recurring tasks, it does not. It does have recurring reminders for ""on going"" tasks which may be useful in certain applications. The result of which being if you click on a task that you do everyday it puts the next reminder on the list giving the illusion the task was left undone. The exact opposite of what a checklist should do. If you want actual individual repeating tasks or list this is not the app."
The best app for to-do lists. It does have a couple of minor issues: * The widget can become unusable once in a while (stuck forever on the loading screen). * It can also take a couple of seconds for an item to be removed after you check it off on the widget.
"It has been an effective motivator and tracker for me to accomplish the smaller tasks that get me closer towards my bigger goals. But there seems to be a Bug - I can't seem to receive a friend's Party invite, though I am able to create my own party and invite friends to it. It's a one way street in my app! Joining guilds and the self-care, self-sabotage info have been most educational and helpful."
"A decent app for its intents and purposes but I struggle to stay invested. It's visually good, great icons and colours, also has a nice selection of skills. My biggest issue is the navigation. I can't immediately see or twirl down to see subtasks. Actually marking something as done, especially subtasks is a challenge - mostly because you face to keep tapping through the task and pages of info to get there. Perhaps a mind map or something would make it easier."
"wish It would link to my calendar so I can create, edit and complete in one location....that would make it 5 stars"
"A software expert. Just purchased this app. It's generally OK, but I am not very impressed. The most glaring issue is that you are confined to the app's predetermined reminder intervals. you have NO option to create your own time intervals (i.e. 12 hours before, 18 hours before, 4 days,5 days before, etc.). They say this app is customizable, as long as it's the developers choice of customizations. look elsewhere if you want total customization. I'll look for more deficiencies and report back."
"List sharing sharing is not working. UX is straight from iOS app, terrible"
"Some reminders get missed and I don't know why, mostly those that must repeat."
After last upgrade widget calendar date not automatically rolling over to next day. Also the widget will not reload when the phone is turned back on.
"The app is very good. It can handle all of my reminders and daily habits. There is a bug tho. When I try to complete my habits or swipe them away in the notification center, my entire phone freezes up for a few seconds. Other than that, its perfect."
after reinstall data not recover while take backup Google Drive
Great app👌🏿👌🏿👌🏿
"The best app around for tracking habits. But the artificial limitation to 5 habits in the free version coupled with the eye-gouging price of the pro version lost it two stars. I paid, but I am NOT happy with the price."
How to use this app? 🤔 Very bad experience. Please simplify the process. Nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day.
"After last update the widget became very small, and clicking on it does not open up the full app. Also won't sync to my calendar anymore. Uninstalling."
"Good app, could be truly great if one more thing was baked in. Imagine if there was a difference between true due dates for tasks and planned dates for finishing them by. I'm envisioning features similar to Trello where you can drag and drop tasks with due dates onto a planning board calendar. This would be excellent for any college students with hectic assignment and exam schedules, or those simply trying to get ahead in their work."
I want a refund. This app worked great but now it doesn't work and tech support hasn't done anything about my issues.
Please make the reminder work!!! It's really important for me to remember things because I forget and don't do it in the end.
Not for me
"I loved this app, but until they get rid of the yearly charge after making us buy it to begin with I'll keep this at a 1. I did previously have this as 5 star, but I can't stand companies doing stuff like this."
Great so far! Does everything I want it to do.
So so helpful! Exactly the amount of customization I need.
The widget doesn't auto update after I add an event. Always need to click the manual refresh button. Same goes for when I delete an event.
Great App
two stars bc i have adhd AND i REALLY wanted it to work. it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out. I'll try again later.... maybe this fall?
"just downloaded. seems to be a simple task / to do list that I was looking for. QUESTION. how do I get the app to be an onscreen Widget, which is shown on the screen shots above?? Thank you"
this app is closing down everytime I try to do anything but daily tasks. rather frustrating...
"The app works great... with wifi. I love the feel of the app and desktop versions, but a decent chunk of my day is spent with limited/no wifi. I can't recommend it for that."
"No graph showing - shows the task sector on phone app, but on watch its just the bare bones time with no events charted."
"Linked it to my MS exchange, sadly It doesnt show the attachments in my calendar entries...shame as this was looking promising...😒😔"
"Simple , quick, reliable and very usefull app. I love it"
Works well but free version only gives you three total lists
This is the best app if you want to plan each and every hour of your day. This app will make sure that no time of yours is wasted at unproductive activities.
"Any.do is gradually becoming my daily tool for managing my schedule, tracking customer debt position. It is a rewarding experience for d money."
"Update - the app is from Hong Kong, and after the recent Chinese law I urge anyone to stop using it. 😞 I use to love the app rated it 5 stars previously, But sadly nothing can be done. 😟"
"I don't care for it, when I first opened it it showed me all these appointments. I was thinking what the heck then I figured out it was showing me weeks passed along with the current. To me that's just a bunch of clutter. Then it was telling me I had five appointments this month, no, only have one, it only showed the one but it still says 5. I don't have a clue what the other four are. Anytime I try to do anyting it practically begged me to join premium, I just uninstalled it."
"Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander. In this day, building your app to only one service is not a good idea unless it's for the iPhone. Now if I could get my work calendar on this app, wow, what a great way to visualize your day. Just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style."
"WHY? Why my habit streaks keep disappearing every single day!? :( Edit: Thank you, developers! I didn't notice that option I love this app❤️"
Worth it! Definitely helps make streamlining your day easier. You're either planning to win or planning to fail.
"It was already very irritating to see your latest added tasks being pushed at the bottom and you have to everytime open the app to rearrange. And with new update you can't even open the app from the widget, you have to create a seperate icon which is super super annoying. Probably gonna uninstall the app if this is not fixed soon."
please add night mode! I study at night and the bright green screen hurts my eyes. Realluy consider this as an option tha many of us who use this app prefer a less bright screen that is better for the eyes.WE WANT NIGHT MODE!!
"Good application! One of the best habit tracker applications available on play store. Should have more features.. like authentication by fingerprint scanner, cloud storage, easily accessible sticky notes daily. The Notes option in daily habit calendar can be improved, perhaps adding a separate tab to view daily added notes would be a great idea ! I would have definitely bought premium, if it had cloud auto storage, better functionality for keeping Notes and fingerprint authentication."
Found easy to use but would be better if you could re arrange order of lists
limited number of habits only 5
Perfect. Only option I would like to have extra is the possibility to see the schedule clock on the screen of the phone before unlocking it in order to have it accessible with just one click
idk if its my phone (android) but i dont receive push notifications nor reminder for this app :/
Who's brilliant idea was to add several Holidays (which you can't even delete) that ARE NOT even US Federal Holidays to this Calendar?
"Updated: It's widget can switch between calander / todolist and view the events for the calander, in the widget when clicking instead of it opening the calander app like most apps. It's task list doesn't seem to sync to gtasks but the calander does. Upgrade to premium to add things like a recurring event, daily planner, WhatsApp reminders, extra colors etc."
Big fan of to do lists.
"App works pretty well, but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life, their Privacy Policy needs to get stronger and be better defined. ""We collect your data; here's a vague description of what. We keep it as long as we've decided we need to; and we won't tell you how long that is. We also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the Policy you may have originally agreed to, but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal. Don't like this? Delete the app"" .. basically the Privacy Policy. Not exactly trust encouraging. Fix this in a privacy friendly way and I'll change my review"
"I really like this app, doesn't give me any trouble. If something happens to my device I don't lose any information because it's link to my account, easy to use and. Although, I would like that in a future update to have the option to order my tasks by alarm/date time, no due day, that's already there, but the alarm and date that I set the task."
"Nice interface and it syncs across my devices. However the widget constantly crashes on both, P30 Pro, Oneplus 7T Pro."
I cancelled my subscription back in June of last year and just realized my membership had been reinstated without my permission. I would like a refund for the months between now and then and (another) confirmation that my subscription is cancelled.
"Seems like a very good idea but how can i edit what i've done the previous day? Eg. If its Tuesday, it seems to be impossible to edit achievements from Monday (which seems like a perfect thing do to on Tuesday morning ;) )"
"Awesome until.... I was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar. This app had some features that made it better than Google calendars. That is, until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment. Now when I save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad. I didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker."
The app lacks tools to view how good I am keeping up with my daily habit/recurring tasks.
"Though Im still new to this app, so far its been super helpful!"
"Quite slow, but overall is ok"
"Friend was permabanned for calling another friend a ""mad c**t*"" in party chat, but here in Australia that's a compliment... TL;DR over-sensitive language filter, should allow party chat to be unfiltered."
The app is just awesome now. Thank you seekrtech for fixing the bugs
"add check system, count system ( how many times) and timer ( count down and count up).. then no need to use other apps...Tnx"
"Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y"
"I've been using it for a while and really find it useful but it duplicates the tasks which is pretty annoying...i suddenly have to exercise 6 times a day XD...I guess that could be benefitial...but no, it's annoying really xD Will be glad to give it 5 stars once that stops happening"
The app does not sync with my Google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option. Meetings etc are not shown and I have to go back to the Google calendar or acalender to make sure I don't miss anything. Events made on my tablet do not show on my phone. Please fix this. It's such a great app if it just worked.
"Great concept, but riddled with bugs. Sign up was horribly difficult, with the servers not responding and the app failing to realize I was trying to change my username and display names. App reset at around 7:00 pm, instead of at midnight of my time zone, which I had double checked beforehand. I want to like it, but this is becoming downright frustrating."
It worked for the first week. Now I can't add a task without it crashing.
The free version is good. Will upgrade to pro soon. Tick Tick is lacking video tutorials online. It looks much more capable than I'm able to figure out. Looking for a todo app that can share lists with others without needing to build a database.
bad. avoid
"Minimum 3 stars, no real problems so far. Nothing to compare it to but its bright and keeping me organized."
"Easy to use, simple functionality but well done"
Brilliant! the developers work hard to always improve an already brilliant resource. Well worth spending a little time and reading the get started and FAQ's.
Crashes on opening the store. Please fix it.
Great so far. I only wish I could set up one task for more than 1 day. It's kind of annoying when you have to do the same tasks daily to have to add them daily. If I could go into the date section and choose multiple days or months that would be amazing. Also making it so I can choose a time range would also be really helpful. Some of my tasks need to be 2 or 3 hrs long and right now I can only choose a time for a reminder. It'll help keep me more organized time wise if you added these. Thanks!
"As soon as I downloaded the app and made a new account, I couldn't create a new character because under the body, skin, and other options to make your character was blank. When I changed my display name, I got a weird message for 'profile.name' required. The randomize button didn't even work for me either. I left originally because there were many bugs with to-do's and other things and I'm not confident it's functional past the character creator, so I don't see a point to continue. On the S10E"
Don't use this unless you sync your tasks. The backup and restore functionality from one device to the next is bad.
"Every update have been a step backwards. All the small changes only made everything less convenient and looks like will only continue to do so. The last straw for me is now you can't add things quickly (to default ""inbox"" project) anymore, now you have to spend several more clicks to designate a project, even though I just want to add quickly to the default inbox. Making the quick add widget useless now. Also premium pricing has always been terrible and greedy (monthly cost instead of one time)."
"I think its a great app, however, i came to this appexpecting a whitelist, wich i didnt get because i have to pay it. This made the app so much worse, if im using my tablet, i need to make work profile abailable to use in order to be in my classes. I can ask if you can add the option to watch an ad to select whitelist, that would definately be a 5☆!"
"idk wht hppen but every time i open the app it stated tht the app hs been 
blocked by system..idk y..btw im using oppo f1s"
I dont understand the idea of an account. Just give me an offline program
It's a great app.. but pricing could be a little lower.
"Okay if you like planning with Google. It's exactly like that, just prettier. I don't see how this can replace a paper planner at all."
"I love how many options you have for setting notifications. My Fasting routine notifies me at the start, 30 mins before it ends, and when it ends. Very cool. The app is missing two pretty big features though. 1. The ability to see how your routines overlap. Right now it's completely unintuitive. You basically have to do math in your head to understand your schedule 2. An indication for what the current time is. Again, math in your head. A schedule is supposed to help you visualize your time"
"This application is worth INSTALLING. It REALLY helps you to remain ORGANISED without any stress. Humble Suggestion: It would have been more convenient, if you had provided 2-3 reminders possible WITHOUT MANDATORY SNOOZE. To understand this concept very clearly, you are REQUESTED to study SnPlan application. All the best."
"Love the app, but I have a question. In the options under daily tasks, we can choose between Daily or weekly, What's the difference?"
It's Chinese so fear of data security issues. Uninstalled it
There seems to be a bug in notification & alarm.when I set a alarm or notification for a particular habit. The app seems to misbehave
"On the widget, you should have make it able to open the app when we click the task (make us easier to do the editing). And also when input new task, I prefer it was put on top instead of below so we can keep track to avoid double input. But so far still ok. Thanks."
I cannot login to the app
"It has everything I want. Grouping, but seeing them together, being flexible in ordering them, giving priorities, and the use of colours. The only improvement I would see is that those colours on the left are very small. I would love to see them better. Otherwise great app!"
"The sub tasks are really a great help in organizing thoughts and tasks. I also love the Projects section! It gives me the freedom to just dump all the stuff in my head, allowing me to have a space for other stuff to think about. My mindspace is feeling a lot freer than ever before, the simple reminder apps just don't work for me. I like the Karma feature too!"
"Great App I can't live without. Just wish they would apply the HTML Code in Tasks so that I can write in bold, italic, etc and I can drag appointments around in Agenda View of the calendar. Good work guys. Keep it up!"
"TickTick is very helpful. I like the various repetition options, especially being able to choose a set time span after completion rather than a rigid every month type schedule. The only downside we have found is that there is sometimes a syncing error between devices."
"Liking it a lot so far, but I don't get it doesn't give a warning ring before tasks I put in. That's kind of the main thing I need it for - to remind me of tasks I had previously put in."
"Пожелание разработчикам: Невозможно перемещать списки подзадач вверх и вниз в версии для Windows. Удерживаю левой кнопкой мыши, тяну и ничего не происходит. Сделайте специальные точки за которые можно тянуть по вертикали. Посмотрите как в Google Keep это реализовано и сделайте также. В мобильной версии у вас тоже удобно, а на ПК просто бесит. Неужели никто не жаловался на это?!"
Loved it at 1st and then it started going weird. Even though I purchased a lifetime I purchased it a second time hoping it would clear up the issues and it only made it worse. Tried to reach out to customer service and they weren't very helpful at all. Then you post and say that I only contacted customer service once? It was actually over 4 times I contacted you via email and most the time the e-mails I got back were so difficult to Understand and varied in suggestions that Didn't work.
Really nice but need some more changes
"If u make an app for samsung gear , I would love that."
"I like this app. If it can sync easily and automatically without delay, I will give it 5 stars"
so-so. not as intuitive right off but fine after a little of fiddling around. but the free version only tracks 5 habits and i dont love it enough to see the value in paying for it since there are other apps out there that satisfy the same thing.
"Confusing. Used to be better long time ago, not anymore. Confusing usability."
Why does this basic app need access to my contacts and refuse to work without? Give me a break you filthy parasites.
"There is a bug in this app. No matter what I selected the ""Change time zone to..."" pop up kept coming up. If this could be fixed I would definitely be interested in using it."
"I really liked the app for its simplicity. That changed tremendously with the recent updates. For example, it now takes me 10 clicks to postpone a single task! People use To Do apps to improve their efficiency, but this app isn't efficient anymore at all. I hope the simplicity comes back with future updates..."
Love it!
This app is not working and gets stopped again &again
"Great interface and concept. What I appreciate most that other apps don't do is that they distinguish between habits, dailies, and to do's!! Props. Also I love the guilds concept as well. One suggestion is maybe have a clear visualization tool too see the progress made. But I get it the point of this app is to level up your avatar! Overall good job 👌"
"Don't like it much Event, Task, Favorites at the bottom confusion. Entering data is tedious too selected hide for completed task it may have deleted them. Need simple customization features and I HATE the computer time task settings which it uses. pros easy to read overview. Thx. mbf"
"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works."
"I am liking the app so far except for the fact that you can only add tasks to ""My Day"" for the present day. I LOVE the idea of a daily list, but it would be immensely better if you could plan for future days. It's super inconvenient to have to add all your tasks the morning of..."
Very helpful in organizing my life
Using this app lead to Microsoft locking my email account and support won't let me unlock it. Wouldn't recommend this app to anyone.
"It is a very good app, but it has many glitches. The widget requires you to open the app to update and in some occasions even when you check some activities as completed they still appear in your list. It is a good app, but it doesn't run smoothly."
"Loving your program, I've been using it for years. Thank you for your work! One function in Todoist is very missing - now when I complete a task on the tab ""today"" it disappears completely. However, it is much more convenient when it gets crossed out and goes to the end of the daily task list (like in Google Keep). When you see a task done today, you're very motivated to do more. This may be a paid function, but it's not in any form in the section ""today"" or ""coming"" now."
skips reminders until I pick up and check my phone. then they go off😖
Ok it was good app but all the good feature are in premium no use of downloading if I'm not satisfied why would i pay for a premium one
"On the surface, the app ticks all the features I require from a todo list, and there isn't a better one out there for me right now (yes, I come from Wunderlist). However, there are some problems that make MS To Do awkward to use. 1. You can share lists and assign tasks. This would work a million times better if I could select multiple tasks and assign them to someone, instead of tapping through 3 different views for each task, one by one, and if I could assign someone while I'm adding a new task. Web version is also missing ""assign to"" in the context menu. 2. When setting reminders, it's really not that convenient to click through a ""shortcut"" menu, when I can never use the times listed in the ""shortcuts"". Not everyone's day begins at 09:00 local time. Can you just let me always skip directly to the date & time picker on both due dates and reminders, so that I don't have to second guess every tap? 3. It's cool that we can have themed lists, but the feature is next to useless when I can't set a default theme for all lists at once. I have 20 lists, not counting the weird default ""Tasks"" list. I'm not gonna go through every single one of them every time I want to change my list background or something."
"Only just started using this app. Looks good but it would be great to have a calender view so that you can easily see what's coming up in the month. Edit: I will go as far as to say that I will end up deleting this app, even though I already paid for it, if there isn't a calender view added eventually."
Wish it didnt have to connect to the calandar. I wanted to keep my phones calandar widget separate from this but its impossible. Disappointing.
A good app but does not show full month tasks and that makes it hard to plan ahead or look back to previous events
The features that were used to convince me to install all require premium access. Will not buy something with so little real use testing.
This is by far the best To-Do app. I gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use Microsoft Account for sharing the lists.
Please build IFFTT integration so that any trigger can cause habit to be set as done/up-counted.
"I love this app so far, but I cannot access the store to buy more trees and plants? Which is a huge bummer, I love all the special little guys that need to be unlocked."
"Easy to use, compatible with Wear Os. Use it as daily apps for tracking my task & really love it."
"The aap good but not some updates are required, such as - In notes section add photo upload option, Add Journal Option,"
The tutorial doesn't help and shows you nothing the app is very bad and isn't easy to understand I have given up after wasting time trying to figure this trash out. I wouldn't recommend this to anyone.
"It talks about Habit building, but in effect it doesn't help much, apart 
from giving very subtle reminders of tasks which, to me, were fairly easy 
to ignore. It doesn't really push oneself to break free of lethargy or 
other excuses which we usually end up giving for not keeping a habit, apart 
from few motivational text snippets. I would like to request you that as 
this app is named HabitBull, you need to Please make it act like a bull. It 
should lead (and at times force) the users to do the right thing. A little 
more aggressive approach to habit building is what could really help."
It was ok but only the first instance of the recurring events shows up on the list/calendar. It is important to see how recurring events impact the schedules in the future so users can avoid scheduling something on those dates/times.
"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me."
"I like the concept, and the free version is passable, but it seems like a lot of features are locked behind the pay version. I may end up purchasing, not sure yet."
"Love this app, bought the Premium (so worth it!) Helps me be productive and keep track on how I spend my time. It's more fun joining timed sessions with other Forest users"
"Sufro de ansiedad y TOC, han cambiado el diseño de la aplicación SIN PREVIO AVISO y no te están las cosas como yo deseo, cómo hago para regresar a ver los colores y los íconos, ESTO ES REALMENTE MOLESTO"
Works great!
"Great app, would be nice to be able to check the checklist items in todos."
"Has failed to sound and show tasks at the right time or at all, yet still put the recurrence on for the day after. I have a reminder set for every two weeks but it went off after only one week so I took my medication too early, fortunately no harm done to me. Uninstalled."
Habit widgets stopped working. After a day they just go blank and don't ever come back. The widgets where my favorite part of this app so that's too bad :(
There should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander
Easy to use. Has everything I want from a habit tracker. Great app. I use it every day.
"I love nearly everything about this app, but it eats up the battery on my phone like crazy because it is always running in the background."
"UI too complicated, not very user friendly."
This is one of the best todo app on play store. It lets you manage your tasks and habits with a beautiful user interface. I have tried other task planner apps as well but all of them are too cluttered and most of the features are paid for them. This app provides habit tracking and analysis of the completed tasks as well.
Too complex as a game! The time I spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working!
Amazing app keeps me in check and credible all the time
This app is great if you know how to use it... I downloaded it and it just doesn't work for me it says it's a routine app but it doesn't really let you put your whole routine it only let's you put one reminder at a time.
I don't know why... but it is showing forest is not responding properly . I really want to use this app again so I reinstalled it twice again but still it shows same problem pls do fix this issue
i need the application thanks developers :)
Why can't you add an attachment?
Awful the concept is great but it is not user friendly and super annoying I deleted it as soon as I downloaded it
Truly amazing app for me. This is exactly what I needed. The colors and themes make me finish my tasks actually. I'll ask you to have the option to set theme from our gallery. Thank you
THE best to-do list app out there!
It's ok. A bit messy.
"I really want to subscribe for premium, but the purchase options are not available, tried alternative option. It's showing unavailable."
"Love this app and use it daily! Great for task managing and motivation if you like games and collecting things! :) There are a couple of bugs though, and the app does not support some of the features available in the web version which i find a bit odd. The phone is the best place to keep a to-do list as it's always with you so i dont understand why the app isn't a priority. Im also missing an option to search or filter my inventory. Other than that i really like it."
I hated the pop up ads.
"It's completely broken, things don't show up, error codes from the very beginning, it's just broken"
Too invasive and complicated.
"The simplicity is nice, but sometimes I want something with more detail. I use it in conjunction with another app. If I don't have a lot of time to enter info, it's great for that. I like that you can change the background to dark which isn't so jarring if you are using just before bed and are trying to avoid being stimulated by technology. I do wish, though, that you could change the setup of a Habit entered between a simple click or entering more detail. Right now you have to create a new Habit if you want to change, but then that changes your stats."
Very easy to use. I have not experienced any problems with this app.
This app launches itself with an invisible overlay over my home screen. That is EXTREMELY suspect behavior and therefore uninstalling.
Does not sync. Not worth it to miss meetings. Force synced does not typically refresh. Back to Google Calendar. Sync is a big part of being a calendar app.
Great app to set and keep goals. You get to set up 5 with free app which is plenty. Love it.
I recently signed up and paid to upgrade to Business Calendar 2 Pro but am not sure how to activate. Need advice.
"Annoying, obstructive ads. got fed up after one had a fake X button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it."
Good
Both useful and fun. I was surprised by how helpful it could be. You can also learn new things from the challenges and guilds.
"It does not seem possible to have a simple shopping list shared with another person... Nice app, but useless."
Good app but faulty notifications. The notifications and reminders were working perfectly but they only work now if I open the app. By that point it's too late. I need the reminders to work to be effective. I purchased the full version.
"Update: still like the app, but now there are annoying timed ads stuck in after saving or editing, so I am taking off 1 star. Very customizable including the widget. I can make it whatever size i want and show me what is coming up at a glance."
"Easy to use, I just use the most basic functions, for almost a year I have had no glitches."
The notification sound isn't coming with this version whether I close or keep the app open. I checked all my phone notification settings and also the app settings. All are on sound yet there is no sound alert after completion of the tree plantation. This is very inconvenient. Please rectify.
great app. could be better if I could have the same habit with multiple notification times so i can do it several times a day without having to recreate the habit several times. thanks
Very helpful and users friendly app.

"This is my favorite to-do type of app, it's gorgeous on an oled display, but I really wish there were a better way to set up repeatable checklists. To start a good habit I find the reminder to do it everyday very helpfyl, but even better is tracking how many times I actually did after a week and when. This app allows repeat events with notifications but doesn't track time completed or show completed or incomplete events on Cal or Google calendar so making schedule adjustments is a chore."
"I came from Wunderlist. The most important feature of maintainung a grocery list does not work, because completed task are deleted after one day. I will look around further."
"Fair enough for ads but now the widget isn't showing anything anymore, it's just blank. I've set up all events and schedule and it's still blank."
"While it sure has its benefits, there's still a lot to be desired."
Everything I needed in one App.
"My phone freezes up everytime I complete or snooze tasks whether it be through the popups or just through the app itself. It gets pretty annoying. Please fix this, thats the only problem with this app."
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks"
"Very excellent, well organised!!! I suggest that more themes may come soon❤️"
"I've been actively using this and I love the concept. App version could really use a new UI. Dark mode would be appreciated, and maybe letting users adjust Font or size of boxes. (Feels too large right now. It would easily hold more details, but space is lost to a big box)"
its alright does same as google maps
It helps me think through all the elements needed to truly cross something off my list.
The functions of the app is great but the video ads causes me extremely high data usage and thus money. I am ok with ads but please provide options for non-video ads ASAP.
I really like this app☺️☺️
"Thought it be a great replacement for GTasks. Main issue with Tasks is lack of pc app. I like the any.do widget as it has a transparent option. I use recurring tasks a lot. A routine which can be ticked and on the next day they'll reappear, which I found seemeles in the Google app. Unfortunately in any.do you need to set a reminder for each task with exact time, they don't stack on each other, creating a long list of notifications in the morning. Also no visual event line in calendar month view."
"I really like this app. The concept of blocking your times is great and I find it helps me structure my time really well. It's also a load off of my mind knowing that I don't need to think about when to eat or what time to check my email because I am at ease knowing it's all planned for and I will be informed accordingly. My only disappointment, with the service and not the app, is that I am unable to structure my timeline online on a PC. I think there are limitations of the mobile device that makes the scheduling somewhat confusing. I think it will be perfect to incorporate a way to set up your schedule on a nice large screen and use your phone for viewing and notifications."
Important features locked behind a pay wall.
Too complicated
"it's a useful app, have maybe some things to improve like, the habit set up is not very clear or intuitive"
"This is what I wanted from long time, best app to sync with both my (Win 10) PC and smartphone. Customized lists (My Day, Planned, Imp. etc) + sorting orders both are best. Scheduling is awesome. Everything what I wanted. Notification for PC is good. (Please fix notification for android, it will be better if it notify like alarm - need user attention to snooze or off - and user can add their own notification tone also). Please don't remove any other thing. I loved the app for both PC+Android."
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.
Very useful app for routine planning. Loved it 👍
"Hi, please provide accepted, pending, decline tags on rutine notifications of activites and also show day progress for these tags or activites in app. I think it will ""force the mind"" to follow daily schedule."
This is helpful but is just a timer ...so it's not a big deal
"Seemed like a decent enough app, but I was looking for a calendar that worked with Google but that I could add local photos to events with, a feature currently lacking in Google calendar. Without that, didn't seem different enough to justify extra install."
It's a great app but I wish you guys would arrange tasks based on their set time instead of be prioritizing them.
"Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People"
"The alarms set, are not going off when they're supposed to...."
"The idea behind the app is nice, but it isn't userfriendly. Finding and adding friends to use it together was so counter productive that it got us to waste time we could be actually doing our daily tasks."
I love love love the app and ever since I bought the Pro version I've had it running in the background and was still able to access other apps I use for studying. The problem is... I can't access the store where you can buy various different trees. So all I'm stuck with are the defaults and the Wisteria tree I redeemed. Five stars if you can fix this problem.
"The wiget is not synched up w the server. It worked until 2 days ago. I had to delete the widget, recreated a new one and all the events show up again."
"Extremely useful, easy to use and integrates well with everything else I use."
Night mode doesnt show up under theme
Only wish missed dailys wouldn't count for the current day too. Otherwise brilliant!
"I bought the pro version a few months ago and I have been very impressed by how well it worked and how useful it is in my everyday life. I am however suddenly having trouble recently with the widgets becoming unresponsive. If I remove the widget and add it again, it works for a while and the stops working again after a few hours. I am running nova launcher on a Xiaomi Redmi note 7. Please assist."
Very nice app but it doesn't have promodomo technology
"Amazing app, the premium is well worth it!!! Love the new UI and the fact that the developers are very active and keep adding new features! I'm glad to be supporting such a great and useful app! Definitely reccomend even if you're not getting premium, but there is no reason not to! . Edit: spelling"
loved it until the last update. now the widgets don't show. just a blank white block that says problem.loading widget. please fix.
Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed
This app is super helpful! 10/10
"Super buggy on Android, have to close and open constantly for anything to work."
Great app. Makes doing hard and annoying tasks more fun.
Spectacular in every regard! Everything is well thought out and implemented in a seamless way that integrates well with other apps and daily life.
Not bad but the best features of this app is contain credit
Had a good time in action movie with Buckley lanky man
Confusing and clunky.
"EDIT, Paid out GOOD money last year to buy Premium BUT you're STILL begging me to RATE YOU. Well my original 5 stars becomes today's 3 stars. Leave me alone, I rated 5 within minutes of buying !! ~ Old Review ~ I've purchased the PREMIUM version, thank you, the best in the play store. EDIT ~ I would appreciate it if next time you have a one day sale you make it abundantly clear in the actual app otherwise I'll never know. Thank you."
good app but had to uninstall. kept adding reminders to all off my tasks and scheduled events even when repeatedly de-selecting them. very frustrating and inconvenient to get the notification and the email notification.
"Very recommended! I'm a student and use TickTick all the time. Even without the premium features (which are very cheap and make the experience much better), this app WILL help you manage your tasks and your time. It's very intuitive and easy to use and you can sync it with your computer, which makes you even more productive. I've been actively using TickTick for quite some time now with the premium membership... Can't say a single negative thing about it"
good
App has stopped opening
Amazing up. I really love it! I have been using it for several months now. It has really helped me to develop very important habits
I love the idea of it but I am having a hard time trying to get started. As I am setting up my dailies anything that I set for weekly seemed like they are all linked together so if I change my days on one task it changes on something else. I like what it trying to do but if this isn't corrected then I will have to find another app.
good so far. only used a few times may review later on.
I absolutely love this app! It's very simple UI makes me want to open and plan my day every single day. Great job MS
Enjoyed it's use while it lasted. Uninstalled now.
Not so usefull
"App was great, but now I cant set my work end times, only starting due to it being restricted for premium only now after the new update. Bad timing guys. Uninstalling app."
"The free version comes with ads, and normally I would be okay with that except that it decides to interrupt you seemingly every minute to ""buy the full version now."" When planning your day, you might have to schedule time to exit out of the constant ad pop-ups."
"I loved this app at first, but now when I change my task dates/times, it doesn't actually change them, and continues to alert me at the original time even though I've clearly changed it. It's very annoying."
It's OK for now havent really done much with the app yet
Very confusing. When problems occur the resolution isnt made clear.
"Easy, simple, cheerful, effective"
"It's crashing everytime I try to tap on 'reminder'. Thank you it's really 
nice but the reminder part is the most important part for me."
"Good App. Lots of customization. But i have noticed an issue with repeating sub-tasks. If a subtask is set to repeat, it won't complete the main task. Seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat."
"I love this app, but have one major disappointment - when I input something in the calendar that lasts more than one day, it doesn't show a solid bar of colour from day 1-last day. Usually at least the first or last day (or both) show up as a separate event. It is very annoying and confusing."
I really like this application. Very well done!  My reason for 3 and  not 5stars is the lack of any security. No option for fingerprint or pin before viewing what could be sensitive personal information.  PLEASE ADD SECURITY!
"I've been using this for about a year and a half and it has helped me hold my life together. It really does help you build habits, you just have to find out what works for you and sometimes switch things up a bit, because there are many ways of going about it. Challenges are very helpful, guilds are a great place to find like-minded people with similar goals and interests, quests done in parties are motivating, and drops like pets and gear are fun. And most importantly, it's doable!"
Absolutely worthless. This app runs a prohibitively clunky interface that effectively voids the promise of ease-of-life automation. Google Calendar will provide all other services promised by Any do for free with no annual subscription rate. Don't sign up for the free trial. It's not worth getting pinged for forty bucks when you decide you don't like it and forget to cancel it in time. Save your money!
I have got the Pro version
Wonderful app. Super productive. Work gets done easier. Faster
"Great idea, but.. I liked this concept and could see how it could definitely help, but some bugs to be worked out and in some place over complicated. Main issue for me was the reminders didn't work on android (galaxy s8) which made this unusable. Also struggled to understand the difference between ""habits"" and ""dailies""."
Weather not accurate. It would be nice task have options on bottom of calendar too.
It just keep on showing only one event whereas there are more than one events
Easy and convenient apps! But the setting to the habits can be more flexible it would be the best!
Need to make more convinient I just set 3 time alarm for the task but it didnt work
Bed application
"Even after entering an event into the app, it is not displaying on the 
clock face, and it says 'no events'. What's the point of the app when it 
doesn't do what it says it can?"
"Hello I really love this app. I wanted to add a small suggestion. Most of the classes and study tools I attend are pre recorded video classes which are not allowed on laptop etc for copyright and privacy purposes. These can only be accessed via phone. So if there is an option to add just one app that can be accessed during the planting, that'd be brilliant since we can study online while avoiding other distractions. Thank you"
The widget doesn't work properly. It only works when i open the app first and then go to widget again. Kindly fix this
its serves a purpose
"I don't know what happening but the store doesn't work anymore and i keep getting this ""error code :664"" ... Edit 09-07-20 : i don't know what happened or what u did but it works just fine now, thank you ^^"
"Very good efforts Everyone who want to focus in their life, make their time more productive should definately download this app. It is very helpful. BUT the only bad thing about this app is that it requires money to create an account. See, users always seek to things or features that they can get for free. I think making the creation of an account free would help your app to spread amongst people."
Full screen ads...
All basic features are paid and the free features are very limited...Very disappointing..
"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!"""
Average app. No worth
Excellent app! I run my own business and this helps me keep all of my appointments and events organized so I don't forget anything.
I like the alerts .. it's a good free app.. I think it be nice if I could click the day then get an option for if I completed my task or not.
Booooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo
Awesome! The layout of your time is done aesthetically and with elglagently presented information
"I thought it was a really good app until today. It started to crush and i couldn't do anything to backup. I lost all of my options, to-do lists,  achievements. Don't know what should i do, really disappointed. Auto back-up should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup files(not dropbox)"
its ok. I haven't been able to figure out how to get reminds
"Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts"
Pretty good.
Don't get any reminders for the goals inspite of setting it a number of times!
"Good app, use it on laptop and mobile device. Suggest to add option to export all (incl completed) to Excel or csv."
"Great UI. The idea is great but need a way to mark tasks/routine item as complete. and so, we can't even know our progress. Guess the use case itself is completely different."
"When I goto monthly view press the date the event is on, the previous date shows up. Sometimes I am able to scroll forward to the date I am looking for,but mostly not. ( for example I scroll April 24th and April 23rd shows up). I like the design of the app,would like to see yearly view. I also can't see Events I posted unless I rotate the phone. But it works for tasks and notes tabs fine?"
"First, the app changed my task name. Then, the task just disappeared and was not in the app. Bad app."
Forced to review to avoid popups every few days. Ok so far
Very easy to navigate. I love it
Overall good. wish I could collapse into a more condensed view or smaller font (too much scrolling for longer lists). Would also like a notepad option.
"Good basic lists, i would like to create more lists, but the annual fee for unlimited lists is too out there"
"This is the best list app for single user and multiple users. Share with partner and family, save time and sanity. What To Do Today? With a little planning the To Do List will help you stay on track with your projects, remember what parts and pieces you need when you need them. Previously called The Wunderlist, Microsoft has actually improved it. Wow! Never thought I would say that."
"I used to really love this app, but lately it won't notify me when the timer is up. It's hard to keep track of how much you're working"
"The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone! Only thing I wish it had: a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits. For instance: most health lost due to *blank* etc."
Cannot create new tags. Even deleted a few to test if it was because I had reached an undeclared quota
"Nice,💥😊"
38/year y'all out your damn minds. Can't even view a full month calendar with the free version. Only day and week. Silly devs.
Nice pleasing UI to look at. App worked ok apart from a continuous problem with unpredictable sync problems. there is a lot of forum activity on this problem as problem has been around for a while. Eventually had to uninstall it because of this problem as it is a core function of the app.
bad
Better to have a search option for notes
Sync not working. Don't buy in-app purchase.
"I use the app as a kind of whiteboard to create a time plan. I am project oriented so when I have an important event to attend to, I might have to plan my day carefully. (If you're moving, you might not be aware of how much time it takes to do everything until you realize you're running out of time.) To use a personal example, I needed to go to court; I needed to be there at 8am, but I get off work at 11pm the night before. So, as soon as I get off work, I have 8 hours to sleep, but I would have one hour to do everything else. Would 6 hours of sleep free up enough time, or would I have to wake up earlier? I needed to figure out how much time to allocate to sleep, breakfast, getting dressed, going over my case one last time, commuting to a parking lot, walking from the lot to the courthouse, going through security, and waiting at the courtroom by 7:30am. The difference between this app and other planners/calendars is that it asks you how you want to allocate freed up time after you shorten a task. On other apps, you might have to manually adjust every task to close any gaps. Thanks to this app, I realized that I needed to prepare by 8pm the night before, so I was able to ask my boss for a half-day of work instead of working my full hours and rushing the next day."
I came here after watching himeesh madan video and like the review of this app but before installing it i checked from which country this app is o found it was Chinese so i became sad and started finding it's alternative and then i revisit the site and i searched almost for hour finding from where this app is and finally i found that it was from taiwan so i became so happy and installed it.
Set up was glitchy. I didnt get further than that. It's a great concept though and the art is cute.
"I immediately encountered a problem when I began, by misclicking on one of my Habits. There's no way to correct for that. Manually change the values, yes, but the xp and hp don't change to reflect that automatically. Secondly, the settings page is broken on my S9, and the issue is difficult to describe. The display freezes so if you scroll, an instance of the text moves while the another is stuck below. Honestly the tutorial really needs work. I could go on but space constraints."
"Love the idea of the app but it's missing a key feature that I need in order to use it. Undated tasks should have the option of showing up every day (under tasks from the calendar/day view) until completed. If that isn't possible, at least a ""view all"" tasks function would be helpful."
"I really like the app but the downside is no offline mode, this will be a better app if it had an offline mode."
"Great app! You can put various tasks into categories, set a task to repeat, add notes etc. It's very helpful in terms of keeping organized. The only downside so far is that the alarm for a task doesn't always go off at the exact time. It sometimes goes off anything between 1-6 min after the set time."
"It's an interesting app ! Try this app To focus on your goals in more interesting and more fun way . By the way , trying this app for the first time !"
"It really feels like I have a tabletop character sheet for myself, and I didn't even know I wanted it until now. The skill and stat customization is incredibly deep. The reward system is great. I highly recommend the premium, if you can afford it. These devs deserve it, and the calendar is a nice bonus on top of all the aesthetic additions."
Excellent app! I run my own business and this helps me keep all of my appointments and events organized so I don't forget anything.
"App is good but I don't have audio using it, how can I fix this? Will rate 5 star if audio will be fixed."
"Very good and gets the job done, not the prettiest or well designed but certainly not the worst! It's exactly how it's pictured and works fabulously too. No crashing or issues here."
My calender does not sync with this app? How can I get it to work. It's great otherwise. How do I sync all my calenders with the he app?
awesome app
Good
"First two slides doesn't load, the character in character creation & menu items are invisible, pls fix."
"It does the job I wanted, that is to ring alarm at the set time. However I am unable to clear the timeline! That is old ones. Couldn't get much help from their help center"
Crazy fun totally functional to-do-list. Good reminders for anything you need to be reminded of. Sinks with your Google account.
Good idea but I cannot connect it with my smartwatch
It was very useful for me to plan my days until the latest update which the widget shows the wrong day and I am unable switch the day..
"Hi Developer. Need to improve note module. It fix only for protrait view, which is when I'm using landscape view (tablet with keyboard), I need to adjust my head or the gadget. TQ"
"I don't know why should I have internet connection to add an attachment to my note. You can let us add it while offline, that's to be suitable for those who have no constant internet connection."
The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for
"Cannot get any of the other calendars to show up other than my Gmail calendar. They're listed in the settings, I've got them checked, but nothing shows up on the main screen."
No adding option for the time
Loved this app but I prefer writing things down
nice planner that replaced paper planner. i absolutely love it! no more spending money on Etsy for digital planners that do not give me notifications. this one does!
"brilliant! I absolutely adore this app. so easy to set up, makes using google calendar for agendas even easier than just using google calendars! the events on the clock face just clicked instantly for me, the fact that they can be colour coded is delightful. the widget is great, and even shortcuts from there can be personalised. I got the pro version even though the free one does everything you need it to. having 24 hour option is good though, and even more colour customisation now. LOVE it!!"
"Events sometimes take a while to show up on the day you selected for them, other times a certain day will not be selectable. choosing midnight as an ending time for an event doesn't seem to work."
Love how functional and pretty this planner is! I paper plan but this is perfect for on-the-go.
helps to concentrate 🤪
"Opaque, complicated, janky. Overall, a frustrating and confusing ap."
"Repeat function does not work making the app useless as a task list. Might 
as well use my calendar. Almost missed a credit card payment because this 
app didn't repeat the task."
"Showed promise, but let down by an incredibly stupid copy function."
"I use this many times daily, and have for YEARS. Very intuitive and easy to change views. I like the slider bar and the ability to quickly show or hide favorite calendars. Moving appointments is a breeze. I have both Google calendars and an outlook one - this app handles both beautifully. Cannot say enough good about it!!!!"
"Not really what I was going for. It's ok I guess if you want to use Google or your phones calender, but I wanted a detailed schedual with alarms to remind me to go to the next event. Love the look, but not useful to me."
"Awesome app to keep your life on track. Would 5 star, but app crashes every time I try and add a custoum sound. Edit: Thank you! Will try again after the next update."
So far I really enjoy this app. I would love more trees and flowers that grow with the longer focus time like how the pine does.
"It does exactly what I need it to do. Calendar, to do lists, schedules. No problems, just easy."
"i bought the premium version, and now it can't even work properly for me. Everytime i try to open the app it fails to start and i have to clear all the app history for it to start. I don't understand why my app is in the chinese version and not connected to google play. Please help."
Would agree that it isnt very user friendly. Functions seem complicated and too basic at the same time
"I like the concept, but the execution needs work. In my experience, the app was laggy non-responsive at times which made the experience of creating and managing tasks tedious."
"Using the free version and it's easy, intuitive, and highly flexible...It reflects just what I want to track for five different tasks each week (from simple task tracking of daily meditation to more complex tasks like 3x a week business actions where I log time spent on these actions and notes too!) I've already recommended it."
"This app is awesome, only thing I wanted was to be able to pause the timer but even with out that feature it is brilliant"
Great until it deletes all your lists. One day opened the app and noticed it said there was a sync error. Attempted to contact support and they just kept suggesting to clear my cache which wasn't fixing anything. If a to-do list app can't reliably keep a simple list not sure it's worth using...
"It is a great app, buy there are some problems, your widget mostly do not sync automatically with my phone's clock, so eventually I have to open the app and set the widget to match the clock. Please fix this, thank you very much."
Keeps me on track.
I just started using it. So I'm not sure how good it is yet. I do really wish you could do bullet points like: * - - That you could check off. It would be much easier in some cases than a separate sub list. & That is currently what I need 😪.
It was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
Its good App
"Great app for those who need extra motivation This is just my idea, but why don't add timed to-do (in image of monsters or something) that will reduce the health of the protagonist (or any negative effects) if they did not finish it on time It may as well push the user to work immediately later than procrastinate, I think I got more ideas but will be too long to write here, so... Anyway, nice app, cool app"
"Updating my previous review. I recently hit the two year mark on one of my habits, yet the app only shows me of having 30 days. This is the same bug I reported last year. It appears that it does not recognize some of my habits over the New Year. I've reported this problem four times now and have never heard back from anyone. I'm giving up on this app, and suggest you do too. ""I've used this for a couple of years. There was a bug where one week of my tracking wasn't recognized by the app. This happened the week of New Years. I reached out to the developer five times about it and never heard back. Unfortunately, this has become an unreliable app for tracking."""
Уууу
I love all of the features. Especially the lists and the stickers.
"When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C."
Unable to manage easily.. complicated
"I love the idea of this app, is quite unique in the way it visually shows 
my upcoming events. Sadly, try as I might, I can't get it to refresh 
correctly with my calendar, its always wing despite following all the steps."
Sufficient for my needs simple to use
Amazing app. I've used a paper calendar my whole life. This visualization and app sold me on going to an online calendar.
Could use more fonts and options and a habit tracker. But it's a great start.
NYC
"Hi, i change ""start day of week"" in the sitting but in the repeat option, when i check the ""skip weekend"", the program skip saturday and sunday!!! if first day of week is Saturday, then Thursday and Friday are weekend, please fix it for 5 stars! this is very important. thanks."
I'd love to see class selection. as an option when you start the game. I was forced to be warrior without an option to change. I even went to setting and nothing there to change it either...
"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume."
24 hour mode is a PRO feature?!
"It's a great app, used it for over a year happily. Even paid for it. Recently had to switch phones and when I reinstalled on my new phone the sync function doesn't work. Without sync i've lost all my data. Tried emailing the developers for support but they don't reply."
"It's testing the edge of my patience. Even though I have better internet connection it keeps saying ""couldn't find the Internet connection. Try again later"". It's my first time. I can't sign in so I can't go in to the app and plan anything. Already I tried reinstall twice."
"Beautiful App ... Always opens to bad news ... Overall percentage failure, rather than positive streaks of even one day ... Willing to upgrade with Habit App ..."
"It's a nice app. I like the reminders it sends every day. It really helps, especially at the very beginning when I used to forgot to practice."
"Had annoyances with the UI, the font was too big for me and I couldn't see a lot of things at once. And for all its gimmicks, it's really just a simple app."
"App UI is really good, i have tried almost all the top task list apps and like any.do best however would like to have Heisenberg matrix added to organise my tasks. That is the one thing stoping me. I want the quadrants features in this app and i would be absolute member of this app until forever."
"I like how the app has options to write notes/journals for each day. It gives you the option to reflect on how you stuck to your habits. Most other apps don't have this feature. That said, I'm rating the app two stars because the notifications don't work for me. I have set times for reminders throughout the day, but the app sends me random notifications (reminders) when I don't want them. And on other days, no notifications at all. No app updates from the developer in over a year either."
"I am quite disappointed that the sorting no longer applies to completed tasks. After years of missing this feature in Wunderlist, it was a very positive surprise seeing that it had been implemented in To-Do. Now it's gone again. If this change is not reverted, I will be dropping the app. It's a nice app but it doesn't serve me without that feature."
"I actually really like this app but one of the biggest features that needs to work properly for my routines is repeating reminders. I set reminds for monthly bills such as rent, and set it to repeat ""monthly"". But when I complete the task, it uncompletes itself the very next day WITHOUT setting the reminder to the next month. Basically if i set it to November 1st, it tries to remind me again, daily, on november 1st. It doesn't work. I love the app but the most important feature is broken sadly."
Why can't I change a single event in a reoccurring series? Am I missing something? It only has 'Change this and future events' or 'change all events in series'
Just 5 habits free !!!!!!
It's good but it's size is large
Lost half its use once they got rid of seeing children categories in the widget. I use ToDoist for homework assignments and I used the parent functions for assignments to categorize what class the assignment is for. Without being able to see all my parent/sub folders from the widget it kills most of the use of the app. I went back to an old APK but then I started getting prompts that the app would stop working if I didn't update. I still use it as a grocery list with IFTTT until Keep is fixed.
This planner app is pretty clear and simple. I have the paid version and it works OK except today they had a glitch and I lost everything even when I reinstalled. It was just so screwed up!  So if you don't mind losing all of your work when they update... I guess it's survivable.
Works exactly how I would expect. I like that I can track multiple goals easily.
Phone: Samsung Galaxy J7 Star I just started using the app. I'll upgrade or downgrade accordingly.
I came across this as I was using Wunderlist before. It is an ok app. It has two downsides: 1. It does not update changes made on one device to all devices. 2. It does not link to Google calendar. With these two features it would become the perfect app such as Wunderlist was.
"Good apps, make my life is better. But, why I can't use ringtone as notification ? I can only use vibration for notification."
nicee
This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature. Resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient!
Can't order important tasks ☹️
"Absolutely love this app and have been using it for months. Different lists in different screens via the widget. Unfortunately the widgets have become unresponsive and now I'm looking for a new app. Will this be fixed ? Using Huawei p20 pro mate for reference Edit: I have reinstalled the app, taken the app off battery saver mode. When I reinstalled it is still the same, clicking on the widget does nothing, can't add tasks at all!"
"This app has great potential but is not there yet. Example, if a task repeats but without notification, then you manually mark it completed. The task is shown as completed & should advance to the next scheduled date. Instead it is showing up the next day as past due. But, if the task repeats with notification, then on the due date/time the system instantly advances the due date but does not show the task as completed so you have no record of the task due today & I have overlooked many. Not good!"
I downloaded this app after hearing good things about it. I had todoist and my subscription ended and I wanted to try this. I downloaded it and brought over all my lists from todoist. After entering everything I uninstallled todoist (bad idea). I decided to upgrade ticktick to premium. Once I upgraded they asked me to sign in which I did. Upon signing in it deleted all the items I had in the app already. Contacted support. Haven't heard back from then yet. What a way to thank me for upgrading.
"I used to love it, but now every time I want to add any tasks it asks for speak text, which when you're trying to discretely add a reminder is offputting. Fix that and you've got a great app"
Definitely improved my productivity... Lately though the sound keeps going off after a few mins and deep focus mode doesn't seem to be working.
"The app is great and has helped a lot even though I'm not using premium. But I think there should be a ""remind me of the habit next time I open the phone"" option, that would be very useful"
Very slow app it took me 10 min just to start the app....
Good app
Too many features locked behind premium.
"It's not working unfortunately. At first it was reflecting then when I added more items, it's no longer working. It just keeps adding the data in the calendar but no graph is being created"
"I would rate it 4 or 5 star.. but it's just that the main features aren't free... Otherwise you can go for it.. It's an ""OKAY"" app."
Gud way to keep in track of our habits
Nice app for daily activities...
I have paid for the pro version inside this app itself. But checking the business calendar 2 Pro app I still am prompted to pay again. Why is this? Why can't I download the Pro version even though I already paid for it?
"Tasks that I change dates does not move to the new date assigned. I'm dismayed because I am a premium member. Moreover, it doesn't have a 1 week or 7 day folder. Apart from the calendar, I also want to see a 7 day list or folder..."
"I would like it better if you could add days of the week that would be 
super helpful. For example, I only workout Monday thru Friday so if I could 
have it remind me Monday thru Friday that would be super helpful"
Ok
"Very useful , cute app but sometimes not ringing or vibrant time out"
"With your friends you can play this game. You progress by completing tasks you set for yourself. Often i see t the app and think, well, 10 pushups isn't that hard, might as well do it. Without the app i wouldn't have thought that. Set small tangible goals. It motivates me to do the things i want to do but can't get in the habit of doing."
"Really head and shoulders above what I have tried before. Simple, intuitive and makes sense. Only occasional times not immediate sync from task you entered with date and your calendar widget and no manual refresh can be done. But this is minor and I still would give 5 stars."
"Waste , there was not an option to set an alarm to remind . I can write a note anywhere , I need the note to remind me which this app said it would . Too busy trying to get me to but it . I will just but an alarm clock"
Love this!
"Looks a lot like todoist. I said ""look"" because todoist is bug free when compared to this one. What a waste of time I had trying to set it up both by natural language and clicking..."
The best app for people with or without ADHD
Was working ok until today...Now keeps crashing the moment you try to open d app...
"need ui refresh though,  widgets need to show text on a month view,  theming... etc"
"Decent, used to be better! Now the tag stays on the text entry line so you have to manually erase the tag between each entry. Very annoying! I went back to notepad and pencil after this update"
Very handy if you're going shopping or need reminders on what you want to purchase. Easy to use and plenty of features.
So far so good for time management
"I miss Wunderlist. It was a near perfect app. To Do, on the other hand, is buggy as heck. The widget almost never works. Lists aren't always backed up properly. I wish Microsoft would have just left Wunderlist alone."
Love the way this app is helping me. Its Great feature is the way we can track our own progress because of reward system. 4 stars only because of app's free theme.
"I forget to do a lot of things i think of during the day, Any.do. is an excellent way to remind me. Just set an alarm, and it will remind you. Even if its something days away.. .I highly recommend it to everyone.. even if your not forgetful.."
"I wanted to buy the app but the subscription feature turned me down. I wish there was a one time purchase option to unlock essential things like calendar, unlimited inventory etc.. (and the subscription for themes, sounds and other cosmetic stuffs)"
This is the only thing that has proved successful in getting me to workout everyday! Simple but v v effective and its always a treat being able to tick off my habit as done at the end of the day :)
It was to difficult and takes a lot of time to create a routine
"I actually tried a lot of apps, and after 1 year with Asana, I switched TickTick. Only 4 stars because the app neither fully supports syncing to Google Calendar, nor does it display the calendar events with the colors which were set in the calendar."
"Love the concept behind the app!! I feel silly but it still works. I am able to complete most of my tasks. My only suggestion would be: please, let the characters not be pixellated."
Wonderful!
"Hi! the range of the nuce coloured sectors does not cover the time interval of my events. It had been the best reason why I chose this app, to have an easy, straightforward overview of my plans. Why doesn't ut work as it is shown on the pictures?"
"Nothing work, I have my calendar prepared for months, and nothing come inside the Sectograph, Even I added new one, nothing appeared"
Nice
It could have been a robust app but these bunch of loosers want you to pay every month is annoying.
"Can't attach photos, says photo too large on Android, and on iPhone it just fails"
"Great app that really makes tracking what you should be doing good. It also makes premium a one time relatively low price and honestly, everything I thought I need to track habits and to do lists are in this app: measurable goaling, reminders, deadlines and personal statistics."
"I have had this app for 2 years and absolutely loved it, after an update it would cut on automatically and freeze my phone. I would have to hit the open apps and close it before I could do anything with my phone. I have emailed and explained what it was doing, and I get am email wanting more explanation, so I did. several days later I get an email that wants a video showing. I don't think this will get fixed i paid for the pro version and i will not renew"
Lacks option to automatically skip all missed recurrences on recurring tasks. Manual skipping of missed recurrences is not a powerful enough solution
"We need an update!! I love this app and use it daily but the fact that we haven't had an update in months bothers me. Here are some suggestions I have: add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task (I use 45 min.), more color options for tasks, an option to change the notification sounds for each entry, a 'push all back an hour' option, and more widget options! Thank you I love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades!"
"Does this works on android 10? I tried installing it and tried to make a character but it seems it's bugging. Doesn't show my character (from character-making phase). Reinstalled it, same thing occurred. Hopefully you guys can help me here. Cheers!"
"I granted this app full access to my google calendar, but none of my events show up in the diagram. It remains completely empty except for national holidays (like National Tartan Day on April 6th. Yay!) I've given this two stars instead of one because this •could• be awesome. The design is great."
"Seems like I really great app, but I just installed it and I couldn't get passed the avatar creation screen :/"
I love the stats it keeps on my progress. It motivates me to get my numbers up a little more each day. Very happy with this app.
Wish I could add more habits
This app has changed my life. I have ADHD and this app allows me to have control over the the things I want to do in my life. Some small critiques would be to add sub lists within other lists i.e. a groceries list with seperate store lists with in. And the ability to move a task from one list to another would be helpful.
it doesn't work |:
"This app was quite useful to have and something I think that I needed. The only thing that put me off was the 'premium '. It slightly ruins it so I would definitely make everything accessible to everyone if I would change something about this app. Other than that, quite handy little app that will probably make a difference to your day!"
"Former version of the app: I tried several task manager services before settling on this one. Lots of good features without unnecessary frills. **** Update **** as of April, 2020... SO disappointed :( Unfortunately Todoist didn't know how to leave something alone that wasn't broken - and added unnecessary frills. The functionality has become too layered and cumbersome. What used to be done in any easy couple of taps now takes many steps. My time is too valuable to jump through the hoops they have created to add and reschedule tasks. After years of paying for the Premium and being one of their top users, I am in the market for a replacement. There has to be something that is more efficient out there."
I use this planner on a daily basis. It keeps me straight! Love it!!!
"Better than Microsoft To-Do, Google Tasks, Boosted, Wunderlist. But still not great because it does not have the simplicity and app task/event logic I am looking for."
Just as good as my old wunderlist app
Hate
Not working
"Amazing App, it changes my life completely, from now on I can utilize my time and measure that efficiency I do advise everyone to avail this one"
I do not use it so I want to cancel the subscription but am unable. Jorte had unsubscribe within opening page. Unable to sign in.
"Love the app so far. Great for motivation, but non-punishing, cute graphics, and lots of stuff to explore. Splitting up tasks by priority/type is awesome. It really has made everyday life feel more guided and fun! Would highly recommend for people who enjoy collecting, gaming, or seeing your progress add up. *One note is that sometimes, lists of tasks disappear/show tasks already completed. Closing and reopening fixes it, but would appreciate it if this bug was addressed."
"Everything about the latest update is as bad as it gets. The bad home screen widget look with extra padding everywhere, no way to add new tasks to the bottom, gives me ride throughout 5-6 pages of the app everytime I delete something fro home screen widget. 😠😠 will be moving to something else."
"Really Good App for tracking! Easy to set, access and monitor. User friendly. With this app I can control my habits. THANK YOU VERY MUCH."
"This app is actually wonderful. I'm hoping you can add the ""forward"" and ""backward"" buttons on the widget (potentially just as another available function of those virtual buttons) like we have access to in the full app. It would be nice to click forward through the calendar and then, say, click the clock center to refresh and reload with the current time."
Good work
Premium is subscription based...thays a huge deal breaker for a TODO program....just saying.
"SLOW on laptop, does not sync with website. No stickers on app, just laptop. I set up my calander on my ohone, then went to desktop. I can't open up my calander unlesss I give payment info on laptop. I already set up payment in Google Play. And to get to that screen takes a LONG time."
"This is a fun and exceptional app for scheduling routine actions. You can also schedule non routine events too. If I had any quibbles, it's that it would be nice to make edits within the schedule for the day I'm on without having to adjust a whole saved routine day. Also, the emoji options could be more expansive (they're pretty good as it is, though). Otherwise, it's an excellent app!"
A very productive app. The only bad thing was that the dark theme was not available for free. Rest everything was fine.
"I was like great wit it until it erased all my schedules, then like magic gave em back 4 that month"
"Was really really excited for this, but then it's glitchy (I ended up with tons of duplicates of the habits which takes forever to delete cause you can only delete individually) and it relies on internet, so I can't use it for when I'm out. Oh well :(("
Great app that aids me in ensuring I stay on track with my goals!!
It doesn't sync up with Google Tasks. Not worth the change. Zapier does not work for Android. Zapier only works if you pay the Premium fee plus it only gives the option to add new tasks and complete tasks when integrating with Google Tasks. It does not import current tasks previously created in Google Tasks. There is no way to transfer my 144 tasks from Google to Anydo. And I can't afford $72.00 right off the bat to do it.
"Overall, the app is pretty good. I have a few complaints, but they don't imapct the basic usefulness of the app. 1. The app doesn't make a noise when a reminder comes up. 2. It has been sporadic and may not keep a reminder posted even when it hasn't been marked complete. 3. The format for setting a reminder day is clunky. Recurring reminders are especially difficult and may not even be available (for example, there is no way to set a recurring reminder to every 6 months)."
"With so many free calendar apps out there, there's just nothing in the free version of this one to make you choose it. The only feature that might set it apart from the competition is the project feature, but you have to pay to use it. Sure, you have the notes feature, but there are ways to accomplish the same thing in pretty much any other calendar, so I just can't see the point. Rather than pay for an upgrade to an app that's just ho-hum (the view isn't even very customizable), I'll be uninstalling."
You cannot change the default online calendar. This does me no good to only have multiple local calendars.
Really helpful app. But it would be great if you guys add lock feature for individual entry. And make the backup feature in such a way so that if i uninstall and then install it again i require a pin to unlock the locked entry. Also if possible add the pin on notification option.
Lower rating until I use it more -just started
Just after I looked at the interface I knew it was what I was searching. Not so for the xp thing which is a very great idea but also how it handle goals like reading books... For anyone who think in terms of goals (and obviously who love RPGs) It's totally free though
It won't allow you to create an account with e-mail address and password. Why give you the option but then doesn't work when you use it. If not resolved within a week uninstalling app.
"Crashes too often PS: Yes, my app is updated and yes, I am a pro user. This is an issue many of my friends have also faced. PS: 8/7/2020. Welp crashed AGAIN."
Not working now after updating
"Its a good way to manage your time, but after a while the timeline menu bugs out and stops sending notifications. Besides that the app is very good."
"Never fails...I suppose you expect that from an app but I've taken it for granted, and I shouldn't. It's reliable, easy to use, and I pull it out several times a day. It's never failed!"
"The app looked very promising, but there were too many ""Upgrade to premium"" notifications when initially clicking through the app. From what I saw, I probably would have paid for a year if I was able to try out the fill app first. Instead, I got what felt like being kicked in the face by upgrade notifications. For these reasons, 3 stars and lost buisness."
I'm shocked there isn't a free trial period for this app. All the things that I'm looking for are premium features and aren't unlocked without a subscription. As a rule I do not subscribe to anything unless I am confident it will add value. A trial would help me make that assessment.
best habit tracker ✓ edit- can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph? It's not accurate- always trending down no matter what.
"Great app for the most part. Functionality is amazing. Sync is great. But, I really hate that this app puts itself on top of whatever I'm doing every 5 minutes exactly. Been through all the settings and turned all syncing off but no. Incredibly obnoxious on my tablet. Haven't had the same issue on my Android phone"
This app is useful. BUT. It would be so much more useful if you could set a routine to be repeated every weekday/ weekend day/ week/2week/4week/month/etc. It is badly in need of this feature. I thought buying pro would allow me to do this and it hasn't helped at all and I'm disappointed I spent the money. Please say that it is an upcoming feature. Resetting routines for every day is really inconvenient!
My life is a game and I should quit to desktop lmao
I love this app but sadly it does not work with active 2 watch. Imagine the possibilities if you could have this widget on a wearable .
Nice app.
Great so far after a few days free trial.
"Please help me after update when i try to unlock plants then app automatically get closed. Saying ""forest stopped working"" of you fix these problem then i will change my review please fix this bugs"
"I have tried multiple kinds of planner apps and this is the best of them all. It is the only one I found that lets me make recurring to-dos, have everything in a calendar view and give each task a duration (paid features), track habits, have focus sessions, subtasks, reminders, get summaries about productivity, and sync with all my devices (MacBook, iPad, and android phone). The free version is good but I highly recommend the paid version. I am more motivated and productive because of this app."
I still can't sign up or log in. Store is empty and it crashes when I press the premium tags in store. Connection errors(Tells me im not connected to a network). Deep Focus still lets me browse other apps.
Very handy tool
Cant wait to try it
I paid for premium but I did not get any notification or upgradation. Still the app is showing the purchase premium option. Feeling disappointed.
Awesome app
Great app. The only issue is that the app doesn't open after the first day.
"It's done it's job very well for me so far. It prompts me to keep it up to date using notifications and accurately tracks my habits. Be aware that the actual improvement must take place within your mind, the app can't change you. It's job is to track your daily habits and present you with accurate visual data on your progress, it does that job very Well."
It dont have Alarm feature
"Got it primarily for reminders. It has a lot of settings for how you want your alarms or notifications, but those are pretty useless when they don't work. Didn't get a single notification to remind me of the stuff I set up."
Very easy to use Not complicated
"This new planner pro for which I paid for life is poorer than the previous version. I take ages to open, does not immediatly delete bring not all old tasks forward. Very bad."
I've recently started using ticktick. so far so good. It would be nice if you could alphabetize the items checked off so that they are easier to find when you want to add them back to your list. I haven't found a list system that does that yet.
"The game aspect is fun, and can provide a little added motivation, but beyond that it's one of the best free to-do apps I've found. The organization is easy, and the breakdown of habits, daily (or other schedule) tasks on repeat, and a one time to-do list give much more depth than apps that claim to be more ""professional."" If you like the game-ify idea this app is great. If you want a solid, free task manager, ignore the cute icons and go with this one as well."
Need options to duplicate List
"All right so to be clear, this app is amazing and I'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it! Even though it's such a great program, it became unusable at day one. It had bugs and limitations that hindered what I was attempting to accomplish. Problems such as: inaccurate characteristics, no quick access from rewards to inventory, non removable default achievements, inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics."
It is a really helpful app. Thank you developers. I'd give it 5 stars if the notifications were somehow better than {overdue} 🤔. Maybe something more interactive [click here] &/or colorful.
"This is a fantastic app to schedule my day. Thanks. Bought the pro version immediately. But if developed for Always on display, it will be very useful. Anyways, very productive time scheduling app."
This app deleted my whole google calender
SWEETY SWEETY Kumari
"I wish it was offline, like people may not have an internet connection always and it will be a little annoying to see that you can't move forward without internet. Also I can find an option to repeat my to do list . Like in Google task you can set a time for it to remind you what to do and also you can make it repeat. It's sad that a app like this doesn't have such a basic thing."
used to be the best calendar available until they decided to put extremely invasive ads. I know it requires a lot of work and I'm perfectly fine with ads. I'm not fine with invasive and deceptive ads trying to trick you instead.
I sent a cancelation request 3 day into the free trial and still you hit me with year. Very disappointed. I won't ever open this app again. besides it is not even a second rate app
"It's a brilliant, well thought-out, superbly designed, flawless app. Adore using it."
"The widgets keep disappearing from my home screen Response to dev: I use both the ""BC2 - Day Pro"" and the ""BC2 - Week"" widgets and they both will disappear randomly (and at the same time, not separately). I am using Nova Launcher; I have other widgets which do not ever disappear on their own. EDIT response to dev: I'm trying with the stock launcher now, but sometimes it will take a day, sometimes a couple weeks"
Having a list of things to buy with items linked to tasks would be great
Doesn't give any notification and nothing I missed a registration!!
Revised rating. Have been using this for a number of years now and I think it's brilliant.
"List feature sucks! I don't need to manage myself so I can't speak to that functionality. I just wanted a list app, preferably one that worked with Google Assistant. Although that feature works great, the list feature kind of sucks. In an attempt to look new and edgy, the user experience went down the drain. I found it clunky & irritating. I shouldn't have to add a new item to the grocery list just to be able to uncheck items I need again. And that's just one of many irritations. AnyList baby!"
"Not sure yet,still testing it"
"The app is pretty good and has good features. However, when I shared a grocery list with my fiance it wouldn't let him accept and it it sent him TONS of emails regarding it. Literally 1 every few minutes for hours and I have no clue how to stop this without him just unsubscribing. Given that sharing is a big part of why I wanted the app, it does put a damper on things for me."
it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.
"Seems like it could have been great for me. However, lack of ability to modify repeating schedule (e.g. which days of the week) is a blocker. Switched to HabitHub for now."
You should have the choice to swipe left and right for different months and just up and down Also change the word title event colors on a particular day to make it stand out.
"Needs to give you the option of adding pictures when note taking. If it had this option would be excellent, otherwise not a bad app."
"been using for couple of years with no issues, till the recent update with ad pushing.. well, can't really complain coz we're using it for free.. but it's too distracting when you're checking your appt during crunchtime. unstalling as a result. reverting back to plain old no fuss google calendar. tks though"
It wouldn't let me try the app. It just told me to subscribe.

Something that bothered with the calendar widget is that tasks that span for multiple days are separated into blocks in contrast to a continuous line.
Wow this is what i was exactly looking for. Bought premium on the first day. Add many more features in the coming updates
"Not bad, pretty basic but its helpful"
otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours... very disappointed ... you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated...
Great app but only if it was an offline app i would've given it a five star... please fix this...
Helps a lot in reminding of tasks to be done on daily basis.
COOL UPDATE GUYS!
"Well, its a nice app. Simple, possibly simplest it could get. I enjoy using it and also helped me a lot. But the app could do more with reminders and also the look of it. Reminders could be with alarms and also the looks can be a little more detailed. Would be a lot better if we had better home screen with icons and graphics instead of lists etc. I would have given 5 stars if it had more looks and graphics to ease out the stress instead of lists of letters and tasks ......"
"I have never seen a more beautifully designed calendar+planner app. Easy on eyes, strikes a great balance between functionality and simplicity (Google and Microsoft calendar apps should take inspiration from this) and ... just great. When I start earning I'm definitely going to buy this app just to show gratitude :)"
"Its ok, bought it, sadly need another payment to customise palette, sad, hope more update come"
"Its super flexible, i love it!"
App is good but no task sync between devices is a big let down
Best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire. They only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if I open any other app. Old standard Android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until I dealt with it - far superior. Please bring that back.
"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it."
"On my S9+, it's started giving notifications some minutes after the event. It actually states it, e.g., ""4 minutes ago."" The time delay varies. I hear the notifications announce on time on my Huawei tablet."
does not update tasks in widget automatically
Great app and easy to use. Would be great if there was a no date option on notes for like shopping lists ect. That aren't just for the day.
"Not much to say here. It's good. Pros • Syncs with your PC via the cloud. A must have nowadays. • Interfaces with OneNote via links in the ""Add File"" section. I use both - that's good. • Displays schedule on mobile home screen. I find Task display best for mobile and Planner display best for PC. • Subtopics are nice if you have a list of things that need too get done under a main topic. • Alarm set separately from due date • Color change or separate listing for overdue items. [I love deadlines. I love the whooshing sound they make as they go by.] Cons • No snooze on mobile. Mobile - alarm rings once (softly) and does not repeat for that notification. It would be nice if you could set it to go off every 10 minutes or so until you tell it to shut up. It does leave notifications in the notification bar. • I don’t see any way to set alarm sound or duration or volume on mobile."
"Looked good, but wasn't. After installing Tasks, my keyboard stopped appearing for all my apps. It was only when I removed Tasks (as a last resort) that the keyboard appeared again."
"If you want to use dark mode, you'll have to but ""premium"". I understand the need to make money off your app, but thats just scummy."
"Mostly works, but it's irritating when you have to log out and back in to force the lists to sync fully. Sometimes it doesn't even work so you have to do it multiple times. And there are times repeating tasks will randomly stop repeating. It's especially upsetting when you've removed over 100 tasks from one list and it isn't reflected on your other linked device, or if you share with another person and eat they see isn't synced."
Can't use it without email.
"I installed every todo list app and I was unsatisfied. Most of them were not offering widget facility. But this app is all-in-one. You can collaborate with other apps as well, make to do lists, set alarms, make folders, set priorities, label your tasks and many more. This app is keeping me busy. Now, I love to do my tasks to update my list everyday."
"I wish I could delete things that automatically show up in my calendar, things like holidays in other countries etc., I don't want ""everything"" showing up that really doesn't pertain to me. If there is a way, I haven't found it!"
"I'm editing my review due to the new update. Dear todoist, the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app. I have to click on the three dots then on move project. This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design. I would tweak one little thing or too, but overall todoist is almost a perfect product."
this app is missing subtasks and obviously no prioritizing subtasks. when subtasks are added if they ever are please make with all the primary task options and a next action option.
It really is worth it to download this app. Thank you for designing this wonderful app! Thanks so much
Missing back buttons on some screens. Otherwise great.
"I really liked the app, helped me a lot with managing my time efficiently 
to get the most out of my day, but since I updated it it started acting up, 
it use to be so easy to simply move routine blocks around and now it's 
setting it's own times or plainly refusing to be moved to a later time 
block, which is infuriating. And the app also slowed down considerably 
after the update."
Widget is not working properly with nova launcher.. Every time you have to open the app to add new task after clossing the app by recent apps.
"This handled tasks exactly as expected. Due dates sort into categories, with overdue tasks exposed as well (a simple thing that Microsoft To Do continues to botch). The best replacement for Wunderlist, even if you have to pay for access to simple things like comments and reminders (worth $5/yr at most, but I'll pay the extra to avoid the UX issues in other apps... for now)"
Why would I pay for this app for reminders? It's just a goddamn simple feature!
"Generally good but has issues, adding a subtask is just weird - why they can't do what wunderlist does with a place to add or a button, and it's all a bit sluggish with some redraw problems. But it has some great ideas to it, so maybe it'll be good in time."
It takes forever to download
Not able to open events into another calender app. It always opens events in my native mobile calender app
Excellent app... Good job!
Doesn't sync with Microsoft Outlook To-Dos categories. Useless to me without this. I'll wait until they add this feature to use. I will keep using Tasks and Notes app until then. That app works great!
"Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me."
Great app! No ads and does just what it says on the tin!!!
Probably the best task managing app out there.
it just crashes every time i want to set timer for no reason!!!
Very helpful with lots of features. I would like to see the countdown mode work on the widget too though. Also it would be delightful if we could add tasks (like the notification) with a button shortcut such as pressing the home button for some time and the prompt would pop up! But still nothing I would pay annually though..
"Could be streamlined better, like being able to see your forest from the beginning"
Love the look of this agenda. List feature is great way to track & complete to do lists!
Not good
Bought the premium version long ago but now it has ad on it.
"Really difficult app to use. Loads of problems and shortcomings. For example, there's no calendar so one can't go back to the day a task was set. I'll give it another week or so but if I haven't got to grips with it by then I will delete the app. This app is far too difficult to use for my little brain (IQ 147) so I have uninstalled it."
"Does not sync across my devices, which it claimed it does. Only reason I purchased. Looking for my refund."
You cant set reminders without paying. What is the point of an electronic to do list if you cant be reminded to do your tasts.
Love it! Gave it a 2nd try and it really helped me stay on track with my routine. Such intuitive tools and functions. The only problem is that it keeps malfunctioning and doesn't update notifs or even the widget
"I love habit bull. I did not expect to feel connected to people when I purchased this app but that is what happened. Realising that other people have challenges with habits made me feel, alive, like I was not alone. I only wish the reminders would play on continuously like an alarm, because sometimes I forget to check things off."
I can't delete tasks from the old challenge anymore
It doesn't remind you for weekly or daily tasks if you don't tap on 'done' circle. Please fix it to remind us although we don't tap on first day's tap to make it done
"Make sure your phone settings are allowing the app to make notifications.The app works great, and is super helpful. The only thing I would recommend is to be able to make custom categories. Right now you can do other, but can't specify. Would definitely recommend app. Update 2- I can't seem to find the setting that lets me see the notifications. I can get it to work but only once then it stops. Would you be able to help me out? After my first review you said you'd be able to if I needed it."
The time displayed does not automatically update. One has to cluck on the widget and enter the app for it to sync with actual time.
I like this app but this is the buggiest app i ever had i been using this for years and still havent fix them
"Looks good, but is for me worthless without notifications. And then 3-4 $ per month in order to activate notifications is way too much. Maybe 1 $ could have been worth in order to move away from Microsoft's free TODO app."
love it never forget to buy if it on the list
Forest stay
Very good reminder
I am running this app on a Droid Turbo with stock  Lollipop installed.  The app has a very nice layout but unfortunately I find it to be very buggy.  It is impossible to create an event that includes Monday and the app can't import recurring events from Google calendar.  I have reported these to the developers and hope the app is cleaned up soon.
"Great addition to having a calendar. I can set text reminders for To Dos from here so I don't have to clutter my family's digital calendar with details for my days. Took a while to get how the app and folders work, but I have a good system set up now."
"I prefer the browser version over the app version. It's hard to find all the options in the app version. The app and browser also don't sync well, and one time I lost all of my health and money upon opening my app version for the first time in a long while even though I had used the browser version earlier."
Love habit forming features! Wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists.
"I love this app, but I do have one major gripe - I want an option to buy premium once (even at a higher price) and not as a monthly or yearly subscription. Edit - very unhappy with developer response to pricing. I want to buy premium for this great product they made, but it's NOT a service. This isn't Netflix. You're going to turn potential buyers away with this pricing model"
"Cute, but seems like it would benefit from a way to set eg monthly or annual reminders for bills and birthdays without going to a Google script."
"Please tell me how to undo an accidentally added habit, I feel like I'm cheating when I delete and re-add a whole habit because it's bugging me. Otherwise the app is a gem. 3 stars till you fix this for me. It still doesn't work, I don't want to delete a task, I want to unclick a habit, because I've accidentally clicked positive/negative and I can't undo it. Even if I click the other one to make it even, it just registers it as a separate log."
"It's a good app, no question about it but it's not perfect. I used it for months after abandoning todoist but I'm leaving Ticktick now. It's feature packed but not as polished as other products. The UI is not great and the app has very different design language as well as features depending on which device you open it on. This lack of consistency as well as poor natural language support doesn't make it the perfect ToDo app."
So so. I expected the ability to attach files to notes and a lot more flexibility with format.
"Really unimpressed that I cannot get notifications unless I subscribe to premium. I can set up memos on my Google calendar & be reminded for free. Why would I pay for that with an app? Without notifications I'll have to remember to check what needs done, where I'm at, etc. I also found it difficult to figure out how to navigate & use what little was included in the free version. Gave up in frustration when I realized that to be actually useful I'd have to pay extra."
The widget has been broken for the last couple of weeks since an update. Please fix it.
Twice lost all data b/c wouldn't sync. Had over a year of data. Had premium and still didn't make a difference. Moving on. Just done. So upset!
"Great app! I use TimeTune to time block my entire day into short segments. A few fixes: [ when scheduling a day in advance, the time auto-sets to 24 hours (ending next day). If I scheduled breakfast from 8:00 AM to 8:30 AM, it automatically sets to 830 AM the next day. Very tedious to change.] [difficult to see overlapping tasks] [no easy way to push an entire schedule back, if you are late on one item, and need to push everything by 10 min for example. You have to change each manually.]"
This is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff. I would suggest add some tutorial on YouTube so anyone can get used to it. and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version.
"They should make a website, that is in sync with your phone"
Free version only supports 5 habits which is basically nothing
"Use Google Tasks! It's much better and FREE 🥳 You have to subscribe £1.50 a momth to get full use of this 🤣🤣🤣🤣 It's a basic reminder app. Had it have been a one of payment of a tenner then I'd have brought it but I hate it when you have to subscribe, especially for something so basic as this. They do it so you subscribe and forget about it. Just greed."
"System works okay, but there are several screwy. Does not appear to be any kind of search feature to find items for also it would be better if more information was provided on how to operate the system."
"I can't be the only one multitasking. Therefore, I don't have time to figure out a basic program. I put in a picture and it was so tiny! I put in my tasks yet some are ""timeless"", some are daily, and there was powerlifting! I'm physically crippled!"
"It's pretty good just few features to be added for it to be even more better eg. Sharing tasks, adding sounds to the notifications popping up. Otherwise I love it"
"Update: developer responded quickly with explanation. So impressed that I'm trying it anyway. ___ Original review: Couldn't move onto SD card, so didn't have the space to keep it and try it properly."
"I'm having the same issue as Jackie Hutton 28/04/20. Repeating daily reminders are no longer working and are being missed due to marking as done from the notification. This wasn't an issue before, and once rectified, the app would definitely be worthy of five stars again. *Edited to add: If it was an issue with my device, surely the problem would have been there from when I first downloaded the app? It's an issue that wasn't there previously and has only been there for the last week or so."
"Widget never loads, making it nigh unusable in the way I used Wunderlist prior to the migration. All my lists are updated just fine in-app, but every item is just ""Loading..."" in the widget. Tried removing the widget and adding it again, tried stopping all services, tried re-installing, nothing works."
Free or trail version has nothing! You can't set a reminder for your tasks!
"Really helps to know when tasks are completed. It would be a solid 5 if, when you shared say with google drive, that the Completed DATES would transcribe in the transfer. Major reason for chosing this app was knowing when something was accomplished. Otherwise a great piece of software. Very functional in task management."
"**UPDATE**. I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon."
Used to work great. Unfortunetly notifications no longer go off for ir making it useless. Have checked they are not blocked
"The calendar should be able to set up recurring events easier. Updated: The calendar still makes it difficult to define a recurring date that occurs on the 3rd Monday, 1st Thursday, etc. It should be more intuitive. Also, it should allow you to define the event type better instead of just birthdays, anniversaries, etc. A custom event type that is user defined would be nice, like job anniversary, named day, National BBQ Day, etc. How do you import a list of holidays from a file (HTML,TXT,XML) ?"
"This seems to tick (ha!) most of the boxes, multiple to do lists, habit tracking, Pomodoro timer. The only place I wish it were better is in statistics and graphs of habit and to do completion"
"I'm just starting out with Habitica and am liking it so far, but the To-Dos would be much more useful if they could be organized by due date. I've got like 25 things on that list, with due dates over the next two weeks or so, and it would be much easier to actually accomplish these things if I could easily see which were the most urgent instead of having to scroll up and down and compare dates in a mental tally."
Very easy to use. Nice features.
good app. The way subtasks are structured are a pain in the ass though :/
"I used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive, taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything. I guess I'll go back the regular Google calendar app. Reply to developer: that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads. For now I'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps."
"Be careful users !!!!! I really love this app, but the deep focus mode seems too evasive & has the potential to collect your data. The deep focus mode feature does not let you choose which permission/controls to turn off. For ex, it requires you to turn on 'enable notification access permission' which lets the app read & collect all the notifications you receive plus personal contacts and messages. Please have an option to have the deep mode feature on w/o all of the permissions being required."
"""Custom Swipe Options"" hidden in premium 😂"
"I really like the app, love my forest and stay at a higher level of concentration. But I apparently reached the limit of real-trees, which is only 5 and way too low! Otherwise a 5 Star experience!"
Simple to use. It seems they will load up features that make it less simple. Maybe they need a simple and enhances mode to choose?
You cannot change the default online calendar. This does me no good to only have multiple local calendars.
"Really don't like that they changed the empty time slots back to the way they were (whenever you delete an activity the activity gets replaced with an empty block separate from the empty blocks before or after it), I find it to be extremely unnecessary. But the new feature of increasing or decreasing an activity in 1, 5 or 15 minute chunks is great, and the programmer feature works well as always, particularly good for planning out studies and work."
Why can't I change a single event in a reoccurring series? Am I missing something? It only has 'Change this and future events' or 'change all events in series'
Good app. However the notification has stopped working.
"It's the worst app ever, doesn't give any reminder doesn't work ..... Just a waste of time!!!!! 👎👎👎👎"
"One of the billions of to-do lists app. Nothing special. Unpredictable non-intuitive behavior, as usual. Useless hints for features, that are obvious. I've thrown this app away after the third time, when I accidentally removed my task while simply scrolling the list."
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc"
"Good tool to manage one or more calendars in one view. Connects to gmail, contacts, phone, google drive and more"
Please fix the widget. It keeps failing to display tasks and asks to restart all the time
i liked it because of plan a tree cz i really needed it but it's expensive soo.. k bye
"Seems like a good idea, but doesn't actually do anything but waste more time. Completely useless. Can't find calendar events. Each event has to be re-entered manually. Why would anyone want an app that is just MORE WORK? STUPID! HUGE waste of time!"
"I really like the app, but I would enjoy it more if there was the ability to manually order tasks through simple drag and drop like in LifeRPG. Also, if there was a quicker way to edit like in Life RPG that would be great. I would be willing to pay as a way of supporting you guys, but right now LifeRPG is more practical and they'll get my money until you catch up. Love the decreasing skills btw :)"
"Really good for managing all my tasks for the day. I particularly love the widget, that always reminds me of my tasks."
Im still getting accustomed i like the simplicity
its good nd loved it but need to more developed
"Full screen ads ruin it all I've been using this since it was just ""business calendar"". It was still $7 back then so I wouldn't buy it but would click the ads every now and then. Now with the full screen ads it's practically unusable. Also, before the dev comes in with the stock ""the free version has ads"" response: no duh it has ads. We didn't pay for the app because its upfront cost is too high so we liked the corner ads. Now you force them to take over our screens. Uninstalled and 1-Star."
"It works perfectly for me and I am loving it. I would appreciate it more if you guys could add weather support on the widget. By that it can replace my Home Weather/Time widget and I could ise only this widget for my Time, Tasks and weather."
"I have used this for a while and, though it isn't a perfect fit, it does a great job of allowing me to schedule alarms for tasks and easy snoozing of those alarms. But they updated and fixed what wasn't broken. Now, all uncompleted tasks show in the task window with no delineation of whether they are recent, scheduled, or past due. Visually, it is very confusing. I'm probably going to dump this app. I would like a good calendar view of things scheduled on each day and it doesn't have that."
Beautiful and detailed app! There are two features that would make it more useful: 1) a counter to keep track of quantity (example: alcohol drinks); 2) a limit which causes a fail if you go over (example: limit 14 drinks in a week or 2 per day)
"It has a lot of functionality bugs. Some of my events were not adding, after restaring the app, other events just disappeared etc. I m really sorry i had to delete it because it looked nice and could be very useful but it s not working. Thanks!"
"Not very easy to use. You can figure it out after you play with it long enough, but over all, not very intuitive."
Your App schedule doesn't update in real time. Troubleshooting makes it work and then again same issue.
This app used to be brilliant. It then began to function regardless of whether you were using your phone or not- essentially just becoming a basic timer. And then now the timer fails and kills trees when youre not using your phone. I just planted a tree only for it to die 20 seconds after when my phone locked.
Widget stopped showing the correct day which makes it pretty much useless which sucks because it was the easiest way to use the app for me..PLEASE FIX!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
"Amazing App, it changes my life completely, from now on I can utilize my time and measure that efficiency I do advise everyone to avail this one"
Awesome app but it kept losing sync with my work calendar which uses Office 365. Hope it gets fixed one day.
Works perfectly. Helping heaps to manage my day.
"Did not enjoy the layout, workflows, rewards, explanations. A+ for the effort."
"Suddenly, again (it has happened before), the widget is empty. I keep refreshing, but the entries vanish."
I cant Register on this app. It always says 'server connection lost '.
"Def prefer this to Google calendar, wish it was easier to see and switch to month view."
Best to do list app available
I couldnt even get past setting everything up before it glitched. I couldnt move on from types of goals. A pop up showed up that said something about strength and attributes.
"Great potential, but I can't use the app to its full extent due to its counter-intuitive layout. Just filling two days in Routine view turned it into an endless scroll. Shame, the app really looked like what I was looking for. Reply: Thanks for taking my review into account. Yes, I think a horisontal orientation would be much better. Maybe leave both options? That way everyone can decide what best suits them."
Bestest app ever I love this app it helped me a lot to remember things I have to do
Great help every day
"Bought the paid version and this was working exceptionally well until recently. My Gmail entries now only appear for the last two years, or so, and not beyond. The Google calendar shows them all, so not sure why it's not synching fully."
I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes
Not easy to use also not effective
"beginning setup wasn't loading at all. signed up using Facebook. since it was not loading, i just clicked next. now I'm stuck with my Avatar with no way to change"
"Why can't I open the app? I used it once and I liked it but the second time when I tried to open it, I couldn't."
"This is an expensive app. That being said, it's the most low-rent experience you can imagine. For example, when you create a list item and need to edit it, you're completely out of luck because that can't happen. The best you can do is delete it and type it in (again) correctly since edit is not an option. By the way, deleting an item from your list is a multi multi step process. (update: developer noted that editing was possible (though, multiple steps required), item deletes still impossible)"
"I sadly had to uninstall this app as tgere was no general opt-out option for direct marketing activity. I could opt out of seeing personalised ads on this app i couldnt opt of my data being collected and combined with other sources and shared by all of their many advertising partners, which for an app like this is just too invasive. Very saddened, as the app does look really good."
Does not sync well between devices. Repeatedly forces log in and wipes tasks
practical and easy to use
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying
good app that does it's supposed to. wish it had some improvements to make it great (suggestions in the in-app forum)
"New update made me little bitter(in routine section ) ,kindly take it back and give the old one. In the routine section , first the app allowed me to edit the routine of daily easily and separately , but now all the days are one by one and not side by side , actually side by side is best and easy to edit , thank you for your reply :-).... Before it was as free but now as constant ad is placed below which is so annoying."
Easy to use. Helpful with dates and templates
"From the reviews, this app sounds awesome. Unfortunately, I can't use it because I need an app that syncs with Google Tasks."
"I wanted an app that would allow me to create grocery lists from web/desktop but access them from mobile. At the time of writing, this functionality still isn't fully working. Grocery lists are categorized on mobile, but the web version just shows a single list with all items mixed together. Auto-categorization has been working on mobile since 2018, but the developers still have not bothered to port this important feature to desktop. Also, I feel that far too many of the options are locked down for premium users, even trivial options like background colors."
"It needs to sync with outlook mobile calendar. It syncs with my samsung calendar, why not outkook?"
It helps me keep track of my tasks very efficiently :)
"I like the idea, especially the differentiation between dailies, habits, 
and to-dos, but I need to be able to see the history. Uninstalled - will 
stick to Daylio for now."
"Nice organizational app with lots of lists. I do wish it would save a task when you add it to a list rather than when you hit the button to save the whole list, I've lost some lists I wrote because I pressed back instead of save by accident. In general love the app though."
Works well but adverts are intrusive and annoying after using for several years now uninstalled and gone back to google calendar 😒
"nice, but there seems to be no way to hide declined events? that makes it much less useful. Would give 5/5 otherwise"
NO INSTRUCTIONS I can't even get started because there are no instructions. I put in list title groceries and that's it when I try to make a list it asks for sub titles won't let me even start a list just sends ya in circles DELETE DELETE
I just wish you could use this offline even if wouldn't record progress. Just make it accessible offline
"Was and is a great app. Used it for years, But now the fullscreen ads are an immediate turnoff. Small ads down the bottom were fine, but forcing me to sit through a full screen ad till the timer runs out is a HUGE NO for me. Uninstalling cos there are plenty of other free calendar apps around that don't force you to wait through adverts."
I always get an option to unblock instead of plant the tree when i press it it says that forest app has recently stopped !!
"I wanted to try out and see how it suits me, but when I was adjusting the start and end of the day, it appears that the end of the day is not beyond 2400. Ppl like me who sleep in the middle of the morning bcos of work tends to end work like 2 or 3am. Especially across different timezones. If that's fixed, I would be glad to pay for the app."
"The app is helpful and has nice features. I would give 5 stars but you apparently you are not able to transfer your lists to another device, unless you have exactly the same version. I had to create all my lists from scratch."
le partage est tres nul.... cest juste un texte envoyé a l autre...
"This app was everything I needed, I loved it. But after thenlast update I cannot log in to my account so I cannot see my daily schedule. Will not trust it again and I have already unistalled it. I need an organizing app which I can trust. Fortunately all the events were synced to my google calendar but notes and tasks didnt.. So I dont know if I am forgeting something that is pending now."
"It's testing the edge of my patience. Even though I have better internet connection it keeps saying ""couldn't find the Internet connection. Try again later"". It's my first time. I can't sign in so I can't go in to the app and plan anything. Already I tried reinstall twice."
"Tasks cannot be ordered by their time. A habit not done is not shown as overdue. EDIT: I checked again to use it, but 1) Recurring task cannot be created. 2) Habits are shown like scheduled tasks. It's motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3) It's more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day. If we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once, it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1/2 (today), 1/60 (total) instead of 0/30 or 1/30."
I deleted this app and it still sends me emails everyday! Its a waist of time anyway
"5 habits for free version is not enough. Instead of limiting habits for free version, disable notifications or cloud storage or inter device sync, theme, calendar support and these similar abilities for free version."
"I downloaded this game in the Hope's that the format would help me with my procrastination and can I just say, its exceeded my expectations. it's so good ! I ended up having to change some of the pre set tasks and rewards to make it more personalized but apart from that, it's great. highly recommend if you, like me, like to procrastinate and make excuses to avoid tasks."
"I was scared when Wunderlist sold but honestly, it's even better now. It's complex enough to be valuable yet is still user friendly. I really haven't tried anything that has come close. Well done - whoever made this!"
I keep running into problematic bugs right away
"Now that we need to pay to lock other app while planting the tree, this app has lost it's purpose. I'll need to switch to another app next month."
it is difficult to set an event or goal without a tutorial
If there is some problem... regarding some phones than you must overcome that... Rest of all things application is great.
Doesn't Sync Anymore! & I Paid For The Pro Version... 😤
Excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones
"Great until last update. Love the app, its a great tool, but since the last update, I frequently get server error notifications, and the app doesn't function in any capacity (can't chat in party, dailies and habits don't refresh, etc.). rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue. I'd happily give this a 5-star if this could be fixed and I could get back to my daily log-ins and updates."
Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.
"honestly I don't write reviews often but this is an exception. this is a really good app if your looking for a to do list. it has a widget so you can put them on your home screen. you can put sub lists inside to do list items. when you complete something it says the date and time you completed it. you can color code them too. for me I have a to do list for every day of the week so I can stay productive all week. this app has everything I want and nothing I don't, it's a no brainer."
"I really love this app, but I can't find any way to make it work on my new (Huawei Y7) phone! I've followed all the instructions in the FAQ and tutorials online, but my trees still continue to grow regardless of whatever other apps I'm using. I hope this compatibility issue is possible to fix and that it gets fixed soon, because I absolutely love this app otherwise."
"Only rated 2 stars because of the ability to sync with the calendar apps on the phone and the ability to cross out any tasks once finished. However, the app is fairly simple with tasks laid out like a shopping or to do list with the inability to edit the timings of tasks. I had set an appointment for 1:30 but the app had automatically set it for 10:00 am and not allowing me to edit it. Also, it would have been nice for the tasks to be laid out in calendar format with color-coding options."
I love it! Would just be great if it also had a function where you can see your tasks in Calender format
"I do not have the premium version, but this app is great for helping me with my procrastination by setting goals with rewards, which in my case is decorating my forest, and helping me live up to them and not quit. It helps me set a goal at the start, and Ali's FINISH it and not get distracted or give up halfway."
widget is not working completely. It does not sync with the app. Plz solve this problem
"Boring and not very effective for me: the visual design is a bit of a yawn and it's too hard to earn rewards without paying. If it works for you, great but it doesn't give me enough gratification."
"An absolutely amazing app with even more amazing potential! I was looking for an app like this for a long time. No joke, enjoying my routines a lot more often ever since I started using this app. Thanks so much for this app!"
"Great app, very usable and straightforward, but I wish the calendar view showed the days you had completed all of your goals for that day. Seeing your progress streak would be very encouraging!"
Genuinely not a good app.
I would give it a 5 but I recently got a new phone and I cannot sync at all. I really needed it to sync. Very disappointed because I followed all the steps in my email. Please help
Like it
"I got the premium version The main drawbacks of this app are: 1- I cannot customize the categories 2- If I do a task earlier, it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3- removing done tasks is not available Just moved to the bottom"
I'm constantly finding little glitches in the game that throw off what I am trying to do when I am trying to earn points. Thank goodness for husband and siblings who have played this enough to know how to fix things when they go buggy but I don't appreciate not being able to go to customer service or send a quick email to help them update the system and fix it.
Nice app although the first sentence of the description of the app isn't nice. Life shouldn't be treated like a game.
To many features locked behind premium
"It takes too long to be fun, and sets you up for failure. At the start you are asked to create a small # of tasks. However, the number of tasks you do is directly related to how fast you level. And a few tasks means it takes a LONG time to get to level 10 which is when you finally get to pick a class. However, you could level faster if you add more tasks, but doing that before you are ready will set you up to fail. This is not discouraged as it should be, and there few goals at lower levels."
"ok so last review i said; 5 trees limit each user, even after i bought the pro version, no more trees after that and i dont think its fair. if you need anything about budget, we will help you by watching ads, collect coins or anything that will help you devs pocket to plant trees. subscription per month for price like the pro version price, i dont think people will dont care to put their money to invest this green movement. nature afterall is all we got. please consider my review, go trees🌱💚"
"It took me a couple of days to figure out how to enter information without data such as 'may' converting to 'date'. I simply had to tap on the word and it reversed the automation. I also found out by accident that a simple swipe down revealed all the sub-tasks that I was entering. I thought I had to go back to the main menu all the time. A simple 'start here first' induction video would be great but the more I practice, the better the app feels. Still orientating, early days yet."
"I have used this awesome app for 3 years at least. Sleek, convenient, powerful. But the recent updates just bring more and very intrusive ads. If that is not reverted soon, I will have to change app. Pissed by how awesome app become awful because someone wants to make money out of other's great job. And thanks for your copy pasted answer 🙏"
there is scope of improvement to make it easier
Nice app
Relaxing
Excellent ap. Like the many configurations and the ap does well to monitor 10 different email accounts.
"I have planned some tasks, I've set a reminder and there is no reminder! The good thing is that it's more evolved than Wunderlist therefore I'm happy about it, however please fix this problem with the notifications"
"I have to agree that the full-screen time-draining ads are not viable for a Business Calendar, regardless of the reasoning behind it. By all means, keep the small rolling ads along the bottom of the screen or alternatively charge a more reasonable fee to go pro. £6 is not an option when there are so many other options out there, such as aCal (which I used to use before BC and am now reverting to)... I'll keep an eye on Business Calendar though because, if you change the ad situation or make the pro price more reasonable, I'll certainly be back!"
I just need notification  tone more than these and much more long
It's good but has some points to improve.
"I liked, but in my cellphone had some bugs (galaxy A8+). I think if this app had a function to sync with the phone calendar (google calendar or samsung calendar) it would be much better"
An app that makes you pay for something for a feature as trivial as reminders cannot be considered as an usable free app
"Good app - the guilt over killing a tree is quite effective (for me, at least). Big wish though - the app forces the screen to stay on which drains battery life, but doesn't support horizontal screen orientation so plugging in the power cord to the bottom of my Galaxy s10 is super awkward. Please add horizontal screen support!"
Sound is not coming while the task is reminding.. How to get sound? without sound while reminding is not useful..please tell how to enable sound
Cant see my character
You want me to pay $5 for the full version so I can set a task to repeat? My phone's planner does that for free.
It doesn't work offline and when I'm actually online I need also a vpn to use it :-(
"It used to be a slick, minimal app that did what it needed to. Then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it. No thanks."
"Not sure why everyone's given this such high reviews. The reminders don't work for me, which makes the whole point of having this app useless"
"I needed a replacement for Wunderlist, which we relied on for task lists for our business & employees. With TickTick, I had to manually type in each task for each list because the Import feature only put them in my Inbox. There's no Home Screen - hitting the return arrow exits the app (not a biggie, just an adjustment). The real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person. Collaboration was an important feature we needed. Using Microsoft's To Do for now."
It's good but it's often stopping and not responding I'm irritated by this..I need to uninstall and reinstall everytime and sync..no problem with my device as it is new and good company..please try to fix it. I'm a pro user.
"Very simple UI. Potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time, some may like it scaled back look. Can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying. Seems costly for the simplicity of the app."
It's silly. Now I'm looking at my phone to see it the plant is growing. The plants are unrealistic. It did not help me stay focused during my Zoom mtg. I don't get it. Uninstalling...
"Been using the calendar for years now. The only problem is I can't figure out which app to keep, as I'm getting dual notifications from this app and Business Calendar Pro. What are the differences between Business Calendar Pro & Business Calendar 2"
"The time in the center of the widget, most of the time does not get updated. You have to open the app and then the widget is updated."
"Routine module and programming is nice. Any plans to make it a tracker app - log if the schedule event is accomplished completely, partially or not accomplished..? For example - drinking water few times a day. Exercising 1hr per day."
Decent todo app for single user. Home screen widget does not receive remote updates
"Best habit tracker I've used so far! Very flexible, good data to work with, I find it motivating, and I love that I can chose exactly what I want to work on, right away. The price is also very very good for what it is (thank you for not making it a monthly subscription!!). The ONLY reason I gave 4 stars instead of 5 is because I love using the widgets however they are quite glitchy. For example today I have 1 habit that dissapeared from the calendar & check off list. Sometimes you can't tick off"
"Okay so... this is a good app, I just don't understand couple of things. First of all, ""My day"" - I feel like you could see there every task you have but just for that day, not for every day and it should be automatic. Also what's the difference between ""all"" and ""planned""? They are the exactly same lists. I wish I could order my tasks in all the lists not just at My day and/or add the time - it would help to plan my day more easily and made me do the hardest tasks first. Otherwise, a good app."
"It's a good app. However I'm disappointed that thr alarm doesnt ring and bevause i missed the remainder I had to pay overdue library fees! Edit: the app's creator is responsive and lovely 😊 thanks for the advise, Steve."
"Hi, i bought the premium version 2 days ago and now its not working, can u help me"
Easy to navigate in order to keep track of tasks.
Nice app to get focused.but gets closed if we try to select any plant.team pls focus on that issue😁
"Wunderlist migration/ Don't like Microsoft To Do. I really miss Wunderlist. I miss when I would save a link to Wunderlist and it would let me select the list I needed, not so in To-do. I'm trying to figure out how to leave To-Do for Trello or Todist. This is a bummer. Might just leave my stuff in To-Do and start all over again."
Very useful. Easy to plan daily schedule. Please keep on improving.
Very convenient app. Surprising number of features. Much better than just writing tasks on a notepad.
The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.
lost the ability to sort to dos by tags. very inconvenient. i used that feature a lot.
"Good and most practical application. But if app's widget could show date, day and current task and next task only or With customization option like that... This would be just awesome..."
It's okay
I am not able to link my gmail and Yahoo emails with it. If this feature is present please have a look at the problem and if this feature is absent please add it it makes tasks more easier.
It is a perfect app for organizing the routine. It is easy to understand the settings and has many customization options.
"Pro user here: I have 2 issues 1. After I clear/kill the app (swipe away in the multi-task mode) the Forest app ceases to work and I can use any other app. Please fix this. (Pixel 2 user) 2. Why can't Pro-users watch an Ad to double their coins? We should have the liberty to avail this feature too. I used to double my coins (by watching 30 second ads) before I paid for the app, and now I can't do it anymore. That's not fair."
You need to pay to add reminder/alarm which should be a basic feature
"Do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing ""subscriptions"" for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable? Do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app, like we used to see? Then this is the app for you! Add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about (and statistically speaking - you will) for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week"
previous it working very fine but now there lots issue with the application. eg. if you had not complete yesterday task it wont allow you complete today tasks even reporting is not working
"Love the app. Best of it's kind IMO. Not perfect but so close! This app has the potential to be used for so much more than just habits and tasks! If I may suggest: - having the "".00"" digits be optional and not by default when setting/entering goals. - having multiple reminder/notification throughout the day on one habit to enter data multiple times a day (ex: 200 push ups a day, with 4 reminders so I can do 4x50 or something instead of having 4 habits) or the ability to group habits."
"This app crashes around 8 times a day. I got to re-install the app every time.Have got the pro version,and repenting for it."
"Very good application ... Only i facing issues is , it's won't work for offline ."
can somebody tell me why the heck wud this app wanna hv accesss to my gmail account???
Is there a way to get my money back? I don't like this app as much as a few others I have. ???
It does not ync eith al the calendars
"Simple to do list. It's ok, but you can't even edit tasks after you add them."
"I bought the Pro version and I'm so happy with this app. I can organise everything and it works with Gmail too. Beautiful, simple, easy to use and customizable! I'm using it since one year now."
"I have used it daily for over a year. It helps me be more efficient by not forgetting things I need to do or pick up at the office, the store, or for work projects. It also saves your lists on their server so if you lose your phone, your work is not lost. Highly recommended."
The app is great but after using awhile it start to lag.
"Been reinstalling and restarting my android for few times, nothing helps but keep saying ""Forest has stopped"" why?? I just installed it for less an hour though. Really need this app. Also been reporting. Please fix this"
"***UPDATE 5/29/19 - I decided to go ahead & do the trial so I could see how the location reminder works. So far I've tried about 3 different locations & none of them have updated. One of them was even my home. This was about 30 mins ago! I've been waiting for the app to work with Google Assistant. It's been saying""coming soon"" for quite some time. When this happens I may consider doing the premium. Until then the 7 day trial is pointless to see how the service completely works. Maybe one day...😥"
It is a great app but it force stops very frequently
"It is such a great app to help you manage your time! I really like the fact that it can set the reminder time in a very specific way, it is perfect for people who have a different schedule everyday. One thing to point out will be the choice of the habit. Although you can type it yourself, wont really affect anything, I would like to have more type of habit to choose except for clicking ""other"". Also, it is sad that you need to pay for back up, but it is understandable."
cant get demo to play .its probably a great app..
Are there any guides out there?
"I've had this app for years- first the free app, now premium. I love being able to schedule tasks as well as events. I create different color-coded calendars for different categories of events, and it's really easy to sync calendars with my SO."
Too expensive.
"To be honest, it's a really good app. It has everything (simplicity, system, ui, etc.) but seriously, if this is really a productivity app, it needs to have an offline mode. Does it really need to have an internet connection every time someone has to check their to do list?"
It gives the option to add a local calendar but doesn't let you use it unless you also give permission to use a Google or Outlook calendar. Kind of defeats the purpose of doing a local-only calendar if I can't actually use it.
Been using the pro version for a long time and it's the best Android calendar out there. It has everything you need. No reason to look anywhere else.
Love the selections I have to highlight my different activities with color on my calendar.
Great app for organising the shopping. I like the way it automatically completes a task if all sub tasks get marked complete.
"Excellent work done by the Microsoft team, really wonderful. Just want a few upgrades, have an option to set a particular list or smart list as home-screen i.e. whenever we open the app we are directly directed to our selected list. And other is that make the app icon interesting, it is very much simple."
The program is really awesome but i'm using the oppo f7 and it doesn't do any notification i followed a guide but it didn't help that's the programs only problem
"I just installed this gem of an app this morning, and love its ease of use. However, there is a minor problem...the date in big numbers on the left is one day behind the monthly calendar."
My entire plan was suddenly removed
"Dear developers, thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app! It was not pleasant at all, believe me!"
Sometimes gets dates wrong e.g religious holidays. Not as intuitive as others. Ok for basic use.
I liked the app well enough to pay for it so I could get my recurring items in order with it but when I set a task as recurring it only shows up on the day that I started with.
"It's really great, is helping me a lot to make a routine."
Does everything I want it to do and more!
The calendar reminders can be very shotty but the overall app is very useful
Those dots on the right of each item are gone. How do you reorder your to do items now?
"Clear problem with sync multiple platform , it just made me crazy"
"Good, better than the other apps"
It would be better if I could see a whole day shedule at once (maybe with applying two widgets that doesn't show the same period of time) or if I could croll time not only in the app but on the widget too.
I don't use Microsoft or Google calendars please integrate with time tree app calendar so I can use your app.
"Amazing app, only wish that when you search it would also look in sub task. Also would like Tags for both task and sub taks"
The app has stopped synching and cant get it working very frustrating. I paid for premium and no one replies to help resolve which is a real shame as the actual app when working is very good.
"It's helpful, but it's also annoying. Edit: I didn't make it clear enough, it's annoying to realize how much I'm failing lol Anyway the app is pretty good I'm just overly sensitive and self criritcal"
"App needs work, poor sync with website"
Synching between my Chromebook and phone is a necessity for me and does not work on this app. The color coding for completed tasks is not intuitive.
It takes some getting used to but then when you start thinking of it as an analog watch it sort of works.
"worked just fine until last month, but the feature to double coins through an ad is lagging a lot...I updated the app but the problem as persisted"
"It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment."
"Feature request: I hope I can manually reorder tasks in label views like it's done in project views. Of course, to be synchronized across all platforms. This will be cool."
How can i change the notification sound ?
👍
"Good at organizing tasks. The ""Highlight"" feature (and more importantly the ability to filter only highlighted entries) is great for managing to-do items."
"reminders are premium features now, means app is completely useless. need to search for an alternative that can migrate tasks now... great 🙄"
What is this - NEXT ALARM (SYSYEM UPDATE)???
"I bought this because it has a really design and features, but I to uninstall it because it's slow loading. It's lagging."
Failed to open many times.. regretting for being subscribed user.. still problem exist..please rectify.. fed up with this app..please make sure that suggested version available.. it is only 4.18.1 available and I have to download the app for every 6 hours..worst appp
I like the calendar but get really annoyed at having to constantly change the colours as they keep going back to default.
I love Artful Agenda!!! It is the beauty and organization of a paper planner with the convenience of being online and on my phone! love the new featured that keep rolling out!
"Things were going great until I switched to a new phone .I can't find out how to sync my tasks and events to the new phone. I installed the app in my new phone and logged in, but the data is not there . I see that the events comes from the Google calendar, and I may be able to do something about that - but how do I sync the tasks ? Pls help."
"Quite good app, but recurring tasks which is a basic function doesn't work correctly, thus making the app useless. Even though I impremented all the instructions for Huawei still issue is there."
"looks great, but reminders/notifications are a premium feature. Google calendar is better."
Need to explore more
"The time in the center of the widget, most of the time does not get updated. You have to open the app and then the widget is updated."
"Great app BUT it takes away access to your data after a while unless you grant full access to email addresses/google acct/ everything. Fair enough request, but not by holding data to ransom. Either that or its been compromised by malware, but I don't think so"
"Just one thing.. ads are a problem, otherwise.. amazing, love it."
Its a very good app . It helps me stay focused . I like the features of this app . It is very easy to use . One feature which I personally love about this app is that we cannot exit this app until we are done with our work but if we did that that our tree will die . It also helps me stay productive . 👍👍👍
"Really amazing, but there are pop-up adverts if you're not a member, and for someone like me that's quite a few adverts daily. Very annoying!, But everything else is PERFECT. FYI The designers have to eat so I'm not mad but God damn that's annoying Would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you don't have to do it later. Just an idea id be up for."
Piece of poo
"I like it a lot, but I think it needs a way to tell what day you're in. It 
does ask if you did things yesterday, but I sometimes get reminders for 
things on the wrong days... It's still a very good resource."
Loaded the trial then emailed about cancelation but email bounced back. Ended up paying $36 for an app I didn't want. No way to contact for refund. Be careful if you buy this. If you try the trial you're stuck paying for it!
Uninstalled within 10 minutes of confusion. What to set where. Not user friendly. Not able to set routines daily programmes. Very confusing settings.
This app noticification sound didnt work...always silent and vibration ...i done everything
"Please add Data synchronisation with Google Drive...So, when we change device we can get our old Data on signing in"
"before was fine. it just happen today that widget shows 'widget loading...' only. i try to resize widget, then it's back. it just a little bug, but hope you can fix."
Don't like not being able to even look at the app without credit card entry and account sign up.
I can press middle button and start using Instagram and still count down continues
"I have had a wonderful experience with this app. It has genuinely helped me keep track of things I need to do. It has help me gain structure in my life and I am really grateful for it. This is from a guy who doesn't even bother to use google agenda. Lol great app, good stuff and I hope they keep improving."
"Too complicated, too many details"
love love love this!!!! its the best of both worlds - paper and digital and syncs with all your calendars ! awesome app!
"first I was using this app but when I downloaded it after a long time then strange problems occured such as the routines remainder are not coming although it's option is on... also when I login back then a caption stating ""no authorisation provided to app"" is flashed... please tell me how to resolve it"
"The interface is very nice and simple, however, once I got down to using it and setting some tasks(five tasks total), about an hour later I went back to the app to make edits, but instead saw the list of tasks that I have set were deleted. If the app has an issue saving the tasks, it needs to be fixed. I will change the rating once that bug is resolved."
Loved it except that it wouldn't save and show me all of my events
Paid for premium. Sync does not work. Publisher does not reply. Started reading reviews and found numerous people with the same problem. Going to try to get my money back. Nice app if you don't care about backups or syncing between devices or customer support. Switched to Goalify and finding them extremely responsive
"Very useful app for maintaining regular 'to do' lists. Adding a task is a breeze. The best thing I love most is YOU CAN ADD SUBTASKS WITHIN A TASK. Like if you want to finish a task in 4 steps, you can add each step as a subtask, and each can be marked as completed or not. You can sort the priority of a task by long pressing it and moving to the desired spot which is cool. And swiping a task towards left side deletes it, which is also cool. Super useful app for finishing your daily tasks."
Greattt app!!
Uninstalled due to frequent restart or login attempts
Used it for a fair amount of time without any problems. Suddenly then asked me to create an account or log using Google or FB. I used my Google one only to discover everything was gone!
"This app is fine in concept, but the ""game"" part of Habitica, arguably the reason you would use this app over other habit tracking apps, is just too boring and not that ""gamey"" to me, which doesn't keep me motivated to keep going back to the app for my habits. Concept is good, execution leaves much to be desired."
"Tried the basic version, liked it enough to buy the advanced version a week later!!! Best for the way I work, without distracting ""cutesy nonsense. "" I wanted a business calendar and that is what I got. STILL USING IN 2020."
"This is an amazing app. You're able to customize almost everything to what you want. There are some things I'd love to see added, though. Some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice, and being able to have a task directly award you with an item, too. Developer(s), if you see this you have done an amazing job, I'll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you."
"I like that it is easy and convenience which is what I'm looking for but I 
also need a way to run analytics of times spent on each task. Will change 
to 5 stars if that is possible."
it keeps bugging out whenever i try to do anything. it wont stop doing ghe tutorial and wont ket me delete tast and stuff.
There is no notification sound after break or time up.Please include this.
It works best till 5 to 6 hours but after a time that didn't stop ringing it is showing that your sittings block the time toon application it rings and rings till I uninstall this application..
Need a combination for habits and dailies
App has too many error to count.
برنامه عالیه اما اکثر امکاناتش پولیه
"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly."
A very great and easy to use app for tracking your habits. I am really happy 🖤
Good that i can link it across devices but i would very nuch prefer if there's a widget kind of thing which makes it easier to access
You guys ruined the Wunderlist app. You changed it in a way that is less useful for me and how I used this app.
"Неплохое приложение для поднятия своей дисциплины в игровой форме. Перейдем к минусам: - Дорого за полную версию Серьёзно, 3400 рублей за полную версию навсегда - это очень дорого! Мне кажется, что автор случайно дописал лишний ноль, 340 - ладно, 3400 - дрого. - Не всё доступно без полной версии... Это немного относится к первому минусу. Теперь плюсы: + Повышение дисциплины в игровой форме: Например, если быть чесным и выставлять адекватные награды, то всё очень классно!"
"Absolutely useless, worked once then never again. Am now living in amonst my household waste like stig of the dump 👍🏻"
"The #1 Best Habit Tracking app in my opinion. You can record the amount of activities you do and see the final result at the end of week. When recording your activities, It shows your average amount of the activities done during the week . This app also keeps my life back on track and reminds me what i need to do throughout the day and its very convenient. This app is extremely easy to use and it is free! I honestly wouldnt be able to live without it. Thank you. ❤️"
"I loved this app when I first got it. Though I still find it useful, the app vs desktop functionality leaves something to be desired. Still, I would have given a higher rating if the app didn't have a habit of moving tasks to a random calendar date instead of the one I selected. I'm not sure I'll purchase a second year subscription."
Really nice but need some more changes
Impress me with something good that was not here during wunderlist. Thank you for screwing my wunder-lists and making me jump through the hoops of remembering skype password
"Very Good app, if you're interested in a easy and very functional solution to plan out days ( like I do, or just for any type of task list. This is my #1 go to"
Notifications are great so far.
Excellent app. The first app in playstore that i got whuch reminded me of my tasks by alarm. Besides it also has to do list and pomodoro function in a single app! Loved it. Thanks TICKTICK team.
"I like the app but the only thing which i personally wanted was, if i were able to share picture with my shared tasks people, lets say i make a task to pay bill with my husband but i want to send him the image of the bill. Other than that better from other apps"
"Great app! Laid out well, lots of ways to change settings based on preferences, and super helpful! I use this for daily, weekly, and monthly tasks, and it has really helped me stay organized and cut down on list-making time. The only thing I wish was different is if weekly/ monthly items would reset after the due date rather than nightly, but I can just check/ uncheck them by hand."
Missing features from Wunderlist. Might need to find a new app.
"This app is amazing! Very convenient to be honest. Everything is just there for u to setup, the interface looks simple but great, especially the dark theme. I love it. One main thing about this app is that the premium section of it does not overwhelm the user. It's there but it doesn't shovel itself to the users face. Compared to the others I've used this is a better deal."
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain"
Great. Really helps me visually percieve all my tasks with time. Wish the interphase was more customizable tho.
it only lets you use it linked with Google calendar. You can't have 2 separate things.
"This app used to be great when paired with Alexa. Every once in awhile the sync would break but disabling the app and relinking the account would fix the issue. This has not been the case for the past several months. Any.do it is no longer syncing with Alexa and based on the reviews of the Alexa app it is affecting a lot of people, has been ongoing for weeks, and there doesn't appear to be a fix coming. Going to give anylist a try to see if it works with Alexa."
This app sometimes missed important tasks and didn't notify.
Is it possible to use this without connecting it to google calendar??
Its new I'll let you know later
Need to integrate with outlook calendar
Greatness
Nice looking app albeit does not seem to sync with Google calendar and not cross platform. Certainly cannot do $15/yr.
Its a bad app at all!
I created a task for picking up groceries and set it to a specific day. Why in the world would the default setting in this app be to override my *do not disturb* setting and ring+vibrate at 5 o'clock in the morning on that day. Even though I like the apps functionality I would never recommend it to anyone with these default settings.
Not so good at all. How to enter stuff and completely useless. Very bad 👎 😕
Need more user friendly interface. But very useful application my mobile.
Nice
Best app for this need
Well this is awkward but I cant even find widget option for this app in phone. Downloaded just an hour ago so this has to be the latest version I believe. The whole purpose was to have a clock on my homescreen that has my calender synced. It doesnt seem to that. May be I'm missing something here? I'll definite give an update of this review if I can figured it out.
It dont have Alarm feature
"Perfect for me, takes some serious investment to set up proberly, but absolutely worth it. However, the impact of skill increases on characteristica is not calculated properly and totally different percentages turn out with the same fraction of exp (or identical numbers with a totally different fraction of the exp). Further more, when i use a task that gives me 100 exp, my herolevel gets stuck at 90/25 and doesnt update anymore. If these minor bugs are fixed, i will provide the 5th star."
Nice concept
"I missed my work today because of your stupid ""weak alarm"" method. This means I've lost some money. Notification reliability should be of paramount importance. If something doesn't work 100%, remove it. Very disappointed. VERY! Edit: I didn't get any warning, nothing. If the other option is the recommended one (which I hate that it adds an alarm icon in the status bar. other apps work without doing this), it doesn't mean the other one IS NOT WORKING. Bad. I'm forced to use the stock alarm for the first event in the morning to be sure, which is very inconvenient"
Hi. I love the application. I am planning to buy the pro version. I'm just wondering if the pro version is a one time life time already
"Great tool. I use it every day. There's a bug, however, that's very annoying. I'm on Galaxy Note 9. When I move the items, there's 80% chance the item will loose previously assigned datetime and will be moved to the Someday list. It's very annoying and time consuming! This is the sorting mode by Time. Additionally, when I choose this mode, majority of items belonging to various lists, unfortunately, will not be sorted by date & time, so I'd have to move them manually... Please fix these issues"
"the app is good ,but it would be better if it had a timeline (Please do something about that)"
why I gotta sync
"This is really helpful for me to get productive and focus on my academics. But recently, the app has been having issues. After using the app for a few times, the app suddenly crashes every time I try to open it and then I can't use it anymore. I tried to reinstall the app a couple of times to make it work again. But the same problem happens again after using it a few times. Please fix it."
"I've been using the app for quite a while, and it seems to work well with Google Calendar, showing my events for the day as claimed by the devs. While I have not experienced any issues and the widget is a must-have on my home screen, customisation options are very limited for free users. That's not a big deal, but I do wish we had at least a bit more."
"This app has replaced my chaotic stream of notebooks, carted around in my various bags until their covers fall off and I no longer know where to find anything. I upgraded to the premium version after using the trial month and never regret it. In addition to syncing with my GCal, I have the tab pinned in my browser so I can organize and share notes across my phone and computer with ease. At the day job we use Asana, but Todoist is my choice for both personal projects/hobbies and freelance work."
😘😘😘😘😘😘😘
Generally good and useful with a clean interface but there's a phenomenally annoying bug where tasks often ping all the way to the bottom of your list when you're trying to drag and drop them.
Best life rpg app that I could find. Support is very helpful and fast at responding. Everything other app I tried was all about them milking money. But not this one.
Absolutely love this app. So much productivity.
It seems so cool and I wanted to use it as soon as possible but it wont even let me log in. It takes 1second to load and then nothing happens
"The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker."
Fine
"I love the interface, the overall concept and easiness of interface. Rewarding and fun to use, has helped me alot with my life goals!"
The app is just awesome now. Thank you seekrtech for fixing the bugs
Does not sync with MS Exchange calendar
Great
"How soon until the list sharing is available? If soon, you have just earned a small business customer."
"I love the app but please, allow me to just buy the app and be on my way, what's up with the subscriptions?"
"Great little app! Love the sounds, in particular cafe Paris. I did have some issues- twice had to reboot, once because the sound wouldn't stop, and once because it never stopped bringing me back to the app. But all in all a great app."
"Love it , just need to increase habits option"
It's simply the best for time allocation to activities and routines.
Fun
After an update started showing really annoying full-screen ads. Been using it for quite some time. Will uninstall
"The ease of use for everyday things is great, I have a note pad, task pad and calendar and I just set a task to call back a customer after hrs.. Sure it might note be a flashy business planner but if you just want something to remind you of events store something quickly for later reference, what more do you need, so far any ads haven't been intrusive the main reason people stop using these kind of apps"
Reliable and adaptable
No es intuitiva
"Cannot share entire calendar and/or task database with other users. Only single daily task shares or individual list collaborations. Edit: very solid low 1 star, 0 if I could, since the developer couldn't even be bothered to read the entire of two sentences of review, acknowledging what features they did have."
Good
its a great app but need to add a version were you can restore your notes if lost my app got erased by accident and i dont have any of my notes saved please consider adding to the app
A very good but incomplete idea. There is no way to track time spent on certain habits. there is a big difference between doing 5 minutes of something and doing it for 1 hour... Besides the statistics are super limited and basic.
The hourly reminders don't work properly. They show up sometimes and sometimes they don't. It's unreliable that way. Otherwise the app is quite nice.
Worst app
"Definitely not for me, it was confusing. But hey if you are a gamer and suffering from mental health stuff. its for you"
"Seems like it may be a good app, but I uninstalled as soon as I found out you have to pay a monthly fee for recurring reminders (which is developed once and costs nothing to maintain)"
would like to change my my class and chat is IMPOSSIBLE to navigate. a simple notification system would make it easy.
Good
Please add today's task to my day automatically. Now it has to do it manually.
it is helpful.
"I'm using it for planning my job and it really helped me with scheduling the tasks, very useful app"
"I had and paid for the premium version back then when it was called ""Habit Bull"" I loved it but since now they changed to ""Habit Tracker"" I no longer have the premium add ons and they expect for me to pay again. No thanks."
Why does it keep crashing!!! Please fix i am premium user and it annoys me to keep reinstalling. In general i support the cause behind this app and easy application. Looking forward to hear back from you. Best Regards Adriel
you basically can't do anything if you don't buy the full version.
Really weird formatting? I'm trying to be MORE organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app
"This is the only app that does what it does and I love the functionality. The only problem is the app is quite buggy and I haven't seen or noticed any updates in years. Would also be nice if there was a website to go with it. I am finally giving up and moving to day by day which leverages google calendar and google tasks. If google would just incorporate tasks into its calendar better, that would do it all."
"There were a lot less options for handwriting, covers, and stickers than I anticipated for something you want me to pay an annual or monthly subscription for. It's a great concept but the execution fell short for me."
"Great app, easy to use. Custom colours and categories for each habit. Limited to 5 habits on the free version is the only gripe"
"it just opens a-calender, so I'm not sure why I need something between me and my regular calendar app."
ITS G R E A T. I LOVE THIS APP.
Lousy app
"App works but I got very disappointed after I purchased the premium features only to discover that sync between devices doesn't work, and that the app developer is completely unresponsive to my support requests, so I wasted my money and am not able to get a refund."
Clean and simple view of my day - absolutely amazing tool for keeping me focused. Wish I'd found it sooner.
"Just as I was about to rate this 5 stars, it only let me have 16 ""subtasks"" It's stupid. Let us have more ""subtasks"" and I'll give you guys 5 stars."
Downloaded the app and the server just did not want to connect and synch my to do list and habits. Gave up after 10 mins.
Terrible can't control whether things repeat it not and a study task is automatically a habit? Stupidly paid for the premium upfront. Agree with others that idk where 4.6 came from.
Heavy
"I'm using this app for work for Due Diligence. When I first installed the app I was sure I could ""search"" my notes for key words now I can't. Am I doing something wrong or is that function not available on this app?"
"Ok, I guess."
Can anyone explain 'any.do moment' and 'plan my day' option in the app??
"I found developers lie about free features. I just turned into day view, I asked to login and then I asked to upgrade! In description this option and several other options mentioned as free."
"limits habits to like 6 or whatever unless you pay, useless"
"I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app."
I cannot re-edit the date like i used to in the last update please fix it. I want to edit it from the text box not from the calender.
"The app doesn't have any option to notify you, so last I played I had difficulty forming habits"
Still trying to get used to the app.
Limited Habits
Will be happy if this app comes with time duration..other that this is a perfect app with which one can easily create tasks
overall decent experience. main areas I'm not happy with are ui design choices. lots of wasted space and navigational steps that could be improved. Wish i could see the content in more compressed format. also no night/dark theme which is important to me when using an app i night pull up before going to sleep or in early morning.
You have to subscribe for the pro version. I'd rather just have one flat fee
"Great concept, but I can't even create an avatar. This is a constant bug listed in reviews. The company says that your selections should show up after you start actually using the app, but how can they when we can't even actually CHOOSE anything. I guess I'll try one of the competitors apps."
When i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesn't remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper
I paid for the pro version because the color coding in the free version didn't work properly. Come to find out that the pro version doesn't have daily tabs for tasks and notes as the free version does. But the paid version does color code. Gaining that feature isn't worth losing the other two. I feel robbed.
Does not store none tasks information well.
i got no notification
Good app but I can't get it to shade in the entire timeframes of my activities like in the photos here. It only has a line at the end time.
"Ever get a phone call from a Salesman whom you don't remember giving your phone number out to? this is the app that does it. it reads your phone number and identity and uploads it to the cloud where it can later be sold to the highest bidder. this app makes sure that it gets your identity because you have to login before you can even use it. once you log in, the game is a huge disappointment. mypoli has everything over this."
"I'd be lost without this app. Love it, keeps me organized"
"A good app. But the rewarded ads are too sensual and sexual content. I know you people charge money from those social chatting apps, but your team can ask them to show ads which are more creative rather than simply attracting through sexual content since most of the people who use this forest app are focused oriented and they will surely not going to like such ads on such a good self improvement app."
"This is a great app and it really helped me do my tasks but it doesn't work properly. For example when I try to move a habit so that the list is in the order I want it to be, the app glitches and the habit is sent back to the top. I know those problems are almost insignificant but it gets seriously annoying sometimes. Fix those little problems and I'll give this app the five stars it deserves."
Good app
Because it takes aiges to download😂😂😂
The Reminder option is not working....I have paid for premium to use the app to its full potential but Unfortunately....The basic feature of the app to remind you to stick to your schedule with respect to habits you creat dosent work....kindly help by resolving this issue... Color code Options are limited that can be assigmed to the newly added habit
"Reduced to 1 star after second repetitive dev response. (edit after dev response) I get having ads, but full screen ads that you have to wait to skip are very annoying. I am fine with ads that appear at the bottom. Great app until the full screen ads appeared"
Rs1050 have been deducted from my account twice for yearly subscription but in the app its showing that i have not purchased any subscription yet
Really is a great tool. Needs a way to export to excel and time tracking per task.
I'm sure this would be a great app... if you could actually use it. But it only allows you do add things from another calendar making it useless if you don't have one.
I set weekly view in settings and for few days the app worked fine but today i tried to go back to months view and i tried to access settings but when i try to do that the app closes
still trying
Good
Good app. They finally fixed the major issues around linking it to your Outlook account. I like the My Day functionality. Adding subtasks works great! Works on all my platforms seamlessly. Allows and remembers user sorting of tasks for those that go in an order. Very well done!
Awesome
great concept
"A nice, solid, basic app for tasks. I enjoy the features of being able to have different projects, priorities and easy scheduling. The push notification doesn't seem to work unless I've recently opened the app, so usually I get a notification of the day's tasks after I've already opened the app to check manually. I'm on a Huawei android. That's a big minus unfortunately."
"Tried a few different personal productivity apps, this is the first which feels like it will stick."
Dark mode should not be a paid for feature in any app. Otherwise this app is ok but feels pretty unintuitive.
No updates long time ago
Easy to use. Great for creating new routines and habits
I really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago. all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened. I have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now. please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app.
"Find another app. Wunderlist was much better. When you sort alphabetically then prioritize an item, it doesn't move to the top of the list. Wunderlist would allow sorting and when it was starred, move to the top."
"The app design looks nice, and has good features. This is a functional planner app. I can access the week view in the free version (though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up), but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version. This is a main feature I'm looking for in a planner app. Also, the look of the app cannot be customized- stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen. There are other free apps that include these things."
Magnifique👌
"Cute, love it but bugs, no alarms that's the only thing keeping it from being 5 stars for me."
Don't like the new changes.
It's amazing
A hidden wonderful music comment and feedback is correct please do it like previous it was
"Trying to set a reoccuring event changes the date to one day before what I set it as. Trying to change the date back just creates a second event. Then trying to delete both events takes several tries, because half the time they don't actually delete. This is really annoying."
A very good Pie chart graphical view of your schedule with nice colours and everything is good about the app specially the graphical side. I'm not a pro owner but also rating 4 stars because of the glitch in app today. My whole sector were invisible today and it just showed blue colour filled circle with only an area of 45° looking as faded blue. And nothing else was there. I also have screen shot of the error if developers need it. Else it's a great app. Soon will buy the pro version.
Excellent app
Amazing app..it helps me to concentrate on my work and get rid of my mobile during study time
Keeps me organised very happy with would be even better if it had functions to support Dsylexia sufferes.
"ANDROID WIDGETS DON'T WORK ANYMORE. clicking on ""done"" circle but nothing updates. Only by restarting the phone, removing and re-adding widget to screen. Uninstalled."
I just switched from Wunderlist. Why cant I share my list with my family to add or delete from?
"I am going to drop this app after years of use because of recent full page video ads which are out of control. Edited to add: of course the free version has ads. Always has, and I don't mind, because *something* has to pay for app development. But these new full page, video that can't be shut down, in your face for many seconds ads are new and intolerable. That was a bad business mistake you can correct. I hope you correct it soon. I'll be checking back to see."
This is very good app but the monthly cost or yearly cost are not worth it for me. I found a free app that does tbe same things.
Repeated to do list do not appear on My day. I missed few. That option should have been there
The application should ask for all required permissions for populating the task reminder. Currently I was struggling for getting an auto population of task reminder. So uninstalling same.
"Very motivational, but what's with the subscription fee!? Fifteen dollars a year??"
It is a good basic list app which is all I wanted. Really like the sharing aspect.
After recent update this app not working properly...(Recent Tasks & Reminder not working)
GREAT APP HELP ME DURING QUARANTINE SO MUCH.
"It would be higher rating but I can't delite some events I don't need anymore.... For example: I still have reminder to pay a credit card which I don't have anymore for 2 years!!!!! If there is a way of deleting the same, please tell me, I'll give it 4 stars. Also too complicated (time consuming) setting exact time you want a reminder for an event...."
"I've loved using this calendar for years. My favorite feature is the bar view in the month calendar. I haven't found any other calendar app that does it this well. But recently they ruined the free version by showing full-screen pop-up ads that play for up to 15 seconds before you can get back to your work. I may have paid for the full version before they did this, but not now. If they're going to force uses to pay up $7 to remove such intrusive ads, I'll just move on to another app."
Please fixed it. Why i can't login my passcode. Damnly. Alot of doc i ve save inside
I have been using Artful Agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features. Now the app makes it even more accessible. I love planning meals and mapping out my day!
SO helpful in tracking my goals! I was just looking for something inexpensive and super basic but there are a bunch of features I didn't even know about that make it way better than basic and TOTALLY worth the price. Try it!
After the update it is crashing most of the time I open the store.
Needs a setting to repeat the task
"Very awesome so far! I really love how customizable this is. It does so much it takes a while to learn how to utilize all the features, but I am super happy 👍. Hope it continues to be great with continued use."
Good
"I don't know if anyone else is experiencing this, but the app glitches CONSTANTLY with Chrome OS. Whenever I flip to ""My Day,"" the suggested tasks flicker on the screen and make using the app impossible. I used it on my Android phone and previously on my Macbook with no problem. I loved the ""My Day"" function and am loathe to switch to a different app, but I don't think I have a choice."
Very useful but completely loses it's value when you don't get notifications of tasks that you need to do even though you put multiple notifications you could get one and none of the others. Other times you don't even get any I mean how are you supposed to stay on time on certain tasks when you don't even get the reminder? Please fix this problem.
"The app is not working well since the latest update (2.37.0): the app crashes a lot when creating or editing tasks, the reminder for tasks and meeting are not working (notifications are enabled), so that makes the app useless. Reinstalling the app doesn't solve anything."
"Used to work ok, now, something is skrewy. Now, if I restart my phone, EVERY SINGLE task comes up as a notification, never mind of when the tasks were/are due, and the schedule I set. Now, after I dismiss tasks, they pop up again, ignoring its schedule. Also, wish app could remember which day the task is for. If you have a daily task that you complete after midnight, it thinks you completed it early and won't remind you later that day. Finally, wish app opened to an overview of all lists."
"I'm coming from Wunderlist, which I loved. This is an okay replacement, but there are two things that should be improved. The My Day list doesn't populate automatically with tasks that are due today, which doesn't make sense to me. You have to manually add them to your day (even though you've already set the due date.) Also, I miss having my tasks separated by list on my day view so that I can easily see what's on my work list, home list, etc. Right now they are just all jumbled together."
"This is cool, I'm on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading. You can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity, as well as penalties for failure. You can even link customizable titles to your level progression (my personal goal: Archwizard of the Order of Ptolemy). Very few features are locked behind the paywall, and everything that is essential is free."
not bad
"I used to love this app but they made the ads much more intrusive, taking over the full screen with countdown timers any time you do anything. I guess I'll go back the regular Google calendar app. Reply to developer: that'd be great if you remove the terrible ads. For now I'm uninstalling and checking out other calendar apps."
best habit tracker ✓ edit- can you guys fix the overall habitbull score graph? It's not accurate- always trending down no matter what.
When ever I go for more than 1 hour it gets crashed Pls do something
Nice reminder app. Easy to use and categorise tasks 🙂👍🏼
It only works when linked to another calendar app....and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm.....
"I'm probably too old for this. Couldn't find the energy/patience to work out how it works (and why was it preset with meditation?), I guess it would seem obvious to someone who uses technology more. Bought a huge paper planner called Trigg instead. Less portable! But it won't crash, malfunction or lost if I break my phone..."
"Lost my custom lists and tasks after the current app update... Like the app otherwise but if it wipes your info, then whats the point? Update: was still there online, signed out of the app and back in. Its all there now!"
Works well until you purchase Pro. After this all your calendar dates are displayed one day ahead (your events on a Monday in your Calendar are displayed on Sunday).
Automatic synchronisation disabled by developers 🤕
"We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity."
"Annoying, obstructive ads. got fed up after one had a fake X button that was designed to trick you into tapping on it."
The changes made to how completed task are handled are not only bad UX but they introduced many quite critical bugs! Please fix.
Really a great app for task management🔥🔥
"As a user of GTasks (owned by TickTick), how do I FULLY synchronise my data with the cloud (preferably Google but will make do with the TickTick servers). I pay for this service but only 40% of my tasks are backed up on TickTick server/cloud. Any and all advice much appreciated. kind Regards John Collington"
Love creating all kinds of lists for different reasons and being able to share with others. It has been wonderful having a grocery list created for my parents we share because I've been doing their shopping during Covid19. Also love the different background photos to choose from!!
Easy to use and does exactly what it says.
"This is an amazing app. You're able to customize almost everything to what you want. There are some things I'd love to see added, though. Some way to have an item reward you with money would be nice, and being able to have a task directly award you with an item, too. Developer(s), if you see this you have done an amazing job, I'll be getting the in app subscription soon to support you."
I am so confused
Same old Microsoft. The app does not have independent storage but uses cell phone's gallery for attachments..... No grouping of starred items per list. No assigning task to person. No ability to manually move important list items. NOT GOOD.
Good app but needs to add daily To do List
Appearance good. Sometimes lags and don't update the time even after an hour.
Great app! but there is an error when I try to open the store to unlock new trees or songs it says (error: 664) I hope to fix that problem soon
I bought the premium. And I can't sync the data between my devices.
My alarm isn't ringing please help. Everything else is fine
Its really a good app. Worth using. Everything is fine but I found a problem : it notifies tasks with a notification sound not a music tone. So one not even know if it has notified if the person is a bit far away from the phone. That's it.
Very good app but I am giving it 4 star because the priorities constantly delete every time I leave the app and suddenly reappear which is very very annoying
"TickTick is not a bad app by any means, but it is too complicated for my needs, so I just went back to using Google Keep, which also has an excellent sync system with its website equivalent. TickTick is especially complex when it comes to the scheduling of alerts, which always confused me to the point where I didn’t understand how to set the reminders that I wanted. TickTick is a fantastic app, but it is quite confusing. I prefer simplicity in the note-taking and reminder apps that I use."
Not so great. The user interface is not friendly. Making the to do list takes far too long and theres no way (that i found) to make a list that repeats daily. I'll just stick to google keep.
Good
Why on earth when I'm on one day and create a task it schedules it for the day before that by default? just why?
"I love this, it has legitimately helped my focus and productivity a ton during this pandemic. I had a lot of trouble focusing at home when my college went online, but this is simple, clear, pretty, and very satisfying. The free version has all I needed but I upgraded just to support the people who made this. I use this daily, even months later. I've recommended it to family, and I'd recommend it to anyone who needs some help staying motivated and focused during all this!"
"Using the app since years, now whenever open the app, trying to save an entry, full page advertisement opens for atleast 30 seconds causes missing what more to enter on different dates, this app is at its worst"
Used it for years. Great app but uninstalled it after they added adds during editing appointments... I use a different app now...
Why so expensive? Microsoft Task or reminder offer most of the features that this app has. Could you please decrease the price a little bit? Or give me some discount? Atleast for the first Year?
"wish the reminder have had a repeat function(e.g. every week), so I don't have to recheck the tasks"
"Max of 9 lists, then you pay 3 bucks a month."
"Waiting for the bug to be fixed which causes the tasks to be moved out of order and disappear,otherwise great app."
Should be available in landscape mode too
Best app 😍
It's great to have an app that allows me to keep track of my to-do list everywhere I go.
"I miss having what used to be starred items organized by the file they are listed under. Now its one massive Iist under important. While the category is there, it was so much nicer under Wunderlist. Please, I hope you bring that feature back. Thank you."
"Sound now works but when I have the phone's Do Not Disturb feature on my wake up alarm task notifies but no sound. I have it set to ignore Do Not Disturb and have it set to alarm. My other alarm app does sound off during this time but not as reliable as Task, so it's not my phone causing no sound issue, what else could it be Stephen? You get it working and you get 4 stars, restore still does not work, gave up on that."
It is confusing.. I ws looking forward to get a list of tasks so tht I can mark it done or not done. 2nd review after receiving feedback from Dev. Steve: Steve I think I don't hv tht much time to personally write to u and I guess thts why play store has review system. I hope this helps. Thnks. If possible try to b polite to ur future customer.
Can't import/sync w/ Google Tasks?
I have just downloaded this app and I can't register. Is there a reason for that?
"Love this app! It's quick and easy to enter tasks, and when I assign a due date/time the reminders pop up to let me know is urgent or due now."
Love habit forming features! Wishing for more heirarchy in to do lists.
"Can't sync anymore, and all my lists are gone after I relogged (no lists when I log in through the browser either). Tried ""Get help"" but no reply for several days now."
"nice app but after enabling it, whenever i tried to open clock from taskbar this aap gets open instead, which i don't what"
Go forward and conquer google keep
"I paid for the premium to save my data to upload to my new phone. Didn't work, deleted ALL of my info and when I reached out to tech. support, no response..."
Has trouble syncing Google calendar. Not all events show up even after clicking sync now. Also tried hiding and un hiding calender but still doesn't sync.
I'm experiencing issues with the reminder option. Whenever I set a reminder I get neither the notification or the popup which as a result makes me forget things. This issue wasn't there before. What can be done to solve this?
Basic features such as reminders and labels need an upgrade. And it costs 3200+ rupees in India. That's how much we pay for an entire year's electricity bill or groceries for a whole month! Way too expensive for such basic features. NKT WORTH IT! USELESS APP!
how to view statistics?
Mostly features are for premium account and you can not delete account once you create. Disappointed with to this app
"Does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics: it only shows 24hrs (12hrs in free version). Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management."
This app doesn't work the way we won't. It doesn't notify after even permitting it.
It's good but Tasks should appear in Outlook calendar rather than having to switch between apps. Should merge both apps.
I want to learn about it
"just downloaded. seems to be a simple task / to do list that I was looking for. QUESTION. how do I get the app to be an onscreen Widget, which is shown on the screen shots above?? Thank you"
Lousy app
"Really awesome app, I think the best one. The only it lacks web version, since it takes kinda complicated process to create and manage all this tasks and habits. With web version it would be much easier."
It's a great organizational tool
Too many items
"I like the idea how it shows my skills but I hate it when it organize the tasks in orders, it sets up automatically wherever it wants. Manual task organizer should be available."
It's good app But it's not free if you want to add more than 5 habit
"Extremely helpful app from Microsoft's garage. This is my go to app for scheduling tasks, managing grocery list collaboratively. It's extremely helpful because I get access to my list of tasks from my computer too. And the best part of all, it's totally free. I give 5 stars here, highly recommended 👍🏼"
"Very good app. The synchronization with outlook is not always happening, somehow, but it is generally very reliable."
Wow! I love how well it integrates with Google's Home products. Verbally adding items to my various to do lists as well as my grocery list is awesome!!
"I absolutely LOVE this app! I am a very OCD person when it comes to being organized and love my planner but really wanted something digital...very portable and environmentally friendly... I found it here! I love the way it syncs in seconds across my devices, phone, iPad, Google home device, and laptop. It’s super user friendly and very customizable! I tried several other digital planners and this one beats them hands down!"
"it would be nice if there are pre-set goals or task to choose from - while the app allow for a high level of customization, it's too much hassle to set it all up properly, not to mention balancing the reward from each task"
"App was excellent till recent, but I'm unable to add new task after recent updates."
"When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C."
Syncing in the background between Android and Mac hasn't worked for months. Have to manually go into the Android app and do a sync. Doing a background sync on Android after every edit or notification that gets updated would be nice.
"Uninstalled...Not at all what I thought it was. This entire app is basically just a fancy way to look at the calendars you already have. Everything syncs both ways, so if you add your actually daily schedule minute by minute to this app you are also cluttering up your calendar(s) with the same things. Would've been neat if it actually had some kind of function, but I don't need to waste sd card space on a calendar viewing app."
this app not sending me any notification.
Fine! *_*
"By far the best habit building and tracking app I have used and I have tried many. Have been using the paid version for 6 months or more and my routines ane habits are the best of my life. You need more than an app, but having a tool like this is KEY. LOVE the flexibility, simplicity and the streak-oriented design. Thank you HabitBull!"
It is awesome super helped me But I have a suggestion you can improve your chat session and to invite members to party you can make so we can explore users and invite them
car
It's good but i think it would be better if the routines could be sorted
"I think it could be more user-friendly, but maybe I haven't explored it enough. It keeps asking for a rating maybe it will stop now."
"Please fix the date format, we're not all backward Americans..."
"Uhmm...hello creator... I just want to ask when I opened the app, it glitches and it will turn back to my home. Please fix this thank you"
"This is one of the best apps for self improvement available for gamers. The idea, the execution, the design, amazing. My only gripe is that the error messages you get only sorta explain what went wrong and I have not successfully used the stat correction page once. Always error messages. Hopefully these bugs get worked out."
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.
Ok
"Just Downloaded so far great, but I'm looking for an application I can use between two or more, i.e. minors etc. Where I can send a task via messenger for example. does this app upload if the other user also has Task?"
"Suddenly the widget I have been using for years is gone. Every time, I update, I am worried of losing the widget or data"
Jibj
very smooth and elegant. works perfect as your daily planner
Super helpful for me. Im bad at doing things in a consistent manner but this app has helped me keep track of things. Its daily reminders are also super helpful.
"I have autism and downloaded this app to help mange my tasks and routine, but after trying to work it out for 10 to 20 minutes, I've decided it's not for me. I couldn't set a very simple habit of brushing my teeth twice a day, or a reminder to stretch twice a week on certain days of the week. Not as straight forward to use or set up as it seemed."
"I deleted a list but I still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list, even after restarting my phone."
"Ok for free but limited. There are better free apps. I want to add details to my DIY jobs, such as prices, links etc. I want to easily share. And I don't want the task to close every time I talk it trying to interact with it. Maybe just me, but limited and a little frustrating. But it's free so how can I complain"
"Wasn't sure to begin with, as it's not all that user friendly... but how frustrating to take a chance anyway & pay for premium only to have it NOT sync with my Calendars....! Wasn't really any other reason to pay for premium except that.... What a small waste of money; it's of no use to me now! 😒"
"This app just ""disappeared"" two of the recent events I listed in, both weddings. Luckily I thought of rechecking a day after inputting them. This has happened a couple of times already. Too unreliable for work appointments, I might get fired when I rely on this app's widget for work appointments. Close to uninstalling, after I check out a good replacement"
"After the task time is over, the app without giving the relax time shows that the relax time is over. It usually happens alternate manner."
"Good BUT... STILL does not handle repeat events such as Daylight Savings Time change (i.e. setting a reminder for the second Sunday of March each year to change clocks that don't adjust automatically). Does not handle ""last day of the month"" reminders well. Also, the list should display an icon by repeating tasks. Backup options are very limited, does not handle integration with e.g. Dropbox. Otherwise it would be perfect for my needs."
It's great for to do lists and categorizing them.
Good
This app helps me to micromanage my tasks and organize my life! You can color code your lists too which makes dividing tasks more pragmatic and visually appealing. It's great! I love it and I continue to get so much more done by using it. I highly recommend it! 4.5+ stars!
"couldn't change time zone, its an hour ahead and no setting to select my time zone"
"This task/project management app revolutionised my life, brought about a clear judgement for prioritizing and balancing work & personal life. My favourite is the recurring task functionality which is excellent for habit creation but not also building consistency in project management. 4/5 cuz I haven't used the premium version yet."
Not Making an Account!
"I cant open this app in many times, what happen??? Pls fix that mistake quickly"
"Loved the app but at some point it stopped letting me look at my tasks 
without instantly crashing so I'm not using it anymore. I'll be sure to try 
it again and recommend it to friends if the issue isn't present next time. 
😊"
Easy to use. Thank you so much for the app and for helping me lead a healthier lifestyle! :)
I got a best friend in daily practice
"Amazing, creative and motivating. Kudos Designers love the Gameboy pixellated feel really made me nostalgic. Amazing app"
"Easy to use, I only use it for the to do list but its perfect."
It's very helpful and helps in time management ☺️
"Simply amazing app. Intuitive combined with necessarily complex, for all levels of users. I also bought pro and look forward to using it (good that you can pay, it gives the devs incentive to support and improve the app) Love it, very clean and useful!"
"I just got the app and it is truly and honestly great! I'm super disorganised but this has really allowed me to consolidate all of my tasks. An incredibly smart, entertaining yet useful, and engaging app. I truly can't oversell it and now I really wanna stop writing this review to go level up my character. I want a staff!!!!"
Numerical entries should default to the previous days value
Very nice
"Great for tracking your bad habits, making new good ones, and building a better lifestyle for yourself. Bought the full version for more habit tracking, which is great if you are dedicated, but $7.99 is a pretty hefty price for just 100 habits, some inspirational quotes, and a mediocre social system. It has helped me better myself over the past week of using it, so I'd highly recommend trying it, at least in the limited free version before buying the full version."
best
"I've been using it for more than a year now and it's great. My productivity has improved since I know exactly what I needs to be done and when. Been using the free version so far, because I didn't need the other features so far. But I'm really considering buying the full version"
Nice
"One of the most expensive apps I have ever seen or tried. Everything costs money. Subscription? Check. Paid themes? Check. I mean, I spent a fortune on apps, and I am in favor of continuous support, but still. Losing my lifetime savings is just not okay. Reminds me of the app Newton Mail where they went from free to Oh My God This Is Expensive. IMO users would sub way more if the options were affordable. Sorry for 2/5 but if an app is inaccessible due to prices, I can't say that it's an ok app"
The app doesn't work properly although i follow the instructions of setting. Sometimes it can block the other apps while I'm planting trees. Sometimes just doesn't.
One of the main bugs in this app is that the widget's time doesn't update on its own. And the time gets stuck at any point.
"Latest update is super buggy; can't change if I want my dailys to be every 2 days, 3 days, etc. because the keyboard jumps up and immediately disappears. Really annoying."
"its a good app, the cool thing for me is that you can comment per day, so if you fail with your habits you can find out what things stand in your way, i withdraw one star because i want to make a feature request: when you select ""all habits "" i also want to see all comments (mixed) this way the app would also be a holistic diary , thx :-)"
"Finally! The supplement to the Outlook app. Integrates well with creating tasks and flagging emails. I'm finding it faster to manage tasks from my Note 10 over the normally used desktop version. I'm now able to manage from my mobile device without being strapped to my laptop. Nor do I have to wait to boot up laptop to process emails, thought, or create tasks. Thank Microsoft for increasing my production. I just started using it today and excited for future use while working from laptop."
"Too confusing, too many categories. Going back to Wunderlist if I can. I liked Wunderlist better. There was more logic to it."
Wood I luv this app cuz now I am well organised n I plan all my project work in. As a student I would advise others 2 download it 2 make ur life more well organized . Thanks a lot ticktick
"Great app, but we should be able to customize list image from our device and customize notifications ringtone, anyway it is a good app, it would be great if you add this"
"I really like this app, as it helps me stay focussed. When did it become obligtory to create an account to buy anything from the shop? Even having bought premium doesn't change that..."
"Amazing system, some what hard to balance custom goals without someone else's help. But fun and helpfully none the less ."
really good app really helpful. but guys if you can change the reminder Sound from notification to Alarm. plzz
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.
"Do not use this app, lost all my data (something like 3 years) go ahead and read other have the same problems, I even have premium. Now its impossible to login back with FB or email. Really, really disapointed. Developers dont answer any emails."
It stopped showing reminders and notifications!!!!!
"The app works with the exception of showing all events on the app. The widget show 12 (9 hours ahead and 3 hours passed.) So when one views tomorrow's schedule in the evening, the app does not show tomorrow mornings event or anything prior to 3 hours before the current time the next day. (A bit of a mouthful but those with full schedule will know what I mean)"
"Please make the widgets more customizable and make us able to change the background transparency. Edit: Looks like you didn't understand. I'm talking about the background transparency of the widgets. Again, if you didn't understand - I'm talking about the ability to change the background transparency, the blackish background which makes the contrast higher and isn't necessary on wallpapers which aren't too bright."
"What an adorable and inspirational app! I have actually done things I was considering putting off because I didn't want to lose too much life and thus important items I really need/like. I've even gotten my partner to download it! It also doesn't penalize you too harshly for ""falling off the wagon,"" so to speak, and not using it for some time. As in, days to YEARS. It's the perfect combination of motivational and understanding, which is the perfect recipe for success, at least for myself. 🤓"
"My phone keeps blocking the apps action no matter what I do. It keep showing it was blocked, troubleshoot, and refresh background task."
There were no Ads when I installed it and now every time I put my schedule there is Ads so I need to wait. It's very annoying!!!!! I will find another app.
"Does what it needs to do. Very good integration with Google Calendar. The time of a task in Google Calendar is standard set to one houre, I'd prefer being able to change the amount of time I estimate to work on a task. Not being able to send emails as a task from different (g)mail accounts is a feature I miss. But overall very good app. Hence 4 stars."
Suddenly the app will stop working and I have to reinstall it again. And each time I install this app I'm loosing my data . App is excellent but this issue is horrible. I already sent mail addressing this issue but no response and same thing is repeating. I'm facing the same problem again. It's horrible. It's becoming worst it's not at all working
Nice one but I can't amend schedule days after habit saved.
"Best productivity app I've found, goal progress tracking, hierarchical task management and progress reports would make it even better"
Great App
Good app but eventually stopped using it as it didn't fit my needs exactly.
"Everything is perfect, except for the fact that daily reminders on habit check feature doesn't work."
"Do you have smart date tagging?? Edit, any updates...."
I wish I could assign steps to people
"I did the free trial. This planner does NOT have push notifications. You can set up your events and appointments, even make them reoccurring, but Artful Agenda App will NOT remind you or notify you. What good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications. If I am going to pay for an app, it should at least have most of the features a free app has."
Really good
"The presentation is slick, highly customizable and the skills and characteristics offer an encouraging meta to ""just do one more thing before bed time"". Liking it! It would have been an easy 5 star if not for the widgets. Unfortunately they do not continue the established level of customizability. Especially rescaling elements of the Ui of ""All Tasks"" to fit it into a smaller screen is missing. Further, there is a bug that ""All tasks are done"" after clicking away two tasks. Oxygen OS 10.3.3"
"You have to pay for the dark mode? Really? It doesn't mattee how helpful this app could be for my life if it damages my eyes a lot more just because I can't afford to go premium and buy the amazing ""dark mode"". At least those whole 2 seconds of interacting with the app were fun."
It's assistance on screen seems to display the wrong resolution when using widgets
It seems to be improved  and noted no option to delete routines and need to go all the days and delete...
"I love this app, its helped me quite a bit. I would love to provide 5 stars, but I'm having issues with no notifications even though I have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when I finish a task. I really hope these get fixed because then this will be the single most useful app I've ever used."
"Still frustratingly basic compared to Todoist. I'd love to move over and consolidate within the Microsoft ecosystem, but there's still so many quality of life areas that are lacking in To Do. Can I suggest starting with natural language support for setting up tasks though? It makes it so much quicker to use."
"5 years after acquiring Wunderlist, Microsoft has still failed to replicate the great to do list manager. Critical features missing include natural language support for due dates (not available for Android or desktop), grouping of lists, and email notifications for reminders. The app has come a long way but man, what a shame it's taken 5 yrs and they still haven't even matched the old app and now they're sunsetting WL. That's 5 yrs which could have been used to enhance an already great app."
it does what it says and does it beautifully.... would have given it a 5 star if it would have been all free . but it definately makes the life easy would easily recommend it to my friends and family
Notifications are great so far.
Got a new phone and app now won't allow me to hit sign in button. Customer service is very slow to respond to help. Love the app for last 2 / 3 yrs but not being able to use now is not worth my $$$ paid for it & to think it just renewed
Too expensive.
Very dependable and easy to use. I have been using this app for a few years without glitches.
"Good but still needs improvements. At least, it should be able to give high priority to task at the moment of creating them."
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.
"I paid for premium when transitioning to a new phone, and my history was transferred. I recently had to un+re-install the App for personal reasons and it does not recognise my account anymore. Creator contact has not responded to numerous courteous emails. EXTREMELY DISAPPOINTED. Wish I could get 3+ years of data back. I loved the App, and the App itself is 5 stars but will only rate 1 due to reasons above. Would change to 5 stars if resolved."
"Useless. Have to pay a subscription to be reminded? No thank you. Honestly a once off fee is fair, but a continued yearly fee. I can see why these guys partnered with Facebook and mark Suckerberg . To suck your wallet. I gave it 3 stars because it is a well made app."
Great for tracking your productivity and gives you a dopamine hit/reward (Trees) for being productive
All the features are premium 😐
"This is garbage. No ""to do"" list, just takes you to your Microsoft account and makes you sign in endlessly. Sometimes it texts a code to your phone, sometimes it says it did but didn't. It never actually works as what it's supposed to, though."
It is what I have looked for for some time. I wish it could sync'd across multiple devices.
Laggy.
"So far it's pretty good. I've been using it about a week. Sometimes it doesn't refresh, but the other users on the app seem positive and friendly. There is a lot that I am learning through users that isn't actually explained in the app. Like if you don't do all your daily tasks, the whole party takes damage. So yeah, no pressure! It would be nice for a better help options or a more detailed in-app-fist-time training/learning session. Every 'first' should option for more info!"
"It needs a better way to Schedule the to do list. An easy way to schedule your day, week and even month. It needs a calendar to see things with a bird eye view. I like the game thing, but it needs more functions and to be more practical."
"I love it... I was looking for something like this for a long time. I love that I can organize my list in any way I want too. I love that I can add colors, thems and mark task done without delete it. The best of all is I can share not only by text but also by email!!"
Very creative. and a good idea too!
"Very user friendly. I'm not very ""techie"" but this is easy."
Nice format views and options. My only suggestion is to improve the options that can be assigned when creating a new event.
The app itself is useful but they charged me three times for one subscription and will not respond to me when I email them.
"I like it but when I put my pass code in to access it,  I goes through but then it says your password has been changed please sign in, but I have to hit the back button on my phone to ignore it so it doesn't make me sign in again,  but when I do hit OK for it to let me sign in again, my password isn't there,  it's still locked but I don't know the password."
"Some good features but overall mediocre compared to my old Wunderlist. If someone shares a list with me I cannot easily join the list. The list is not auto synced with my profile. Instead I'm sent an email with a ""join list"" button. But even when I click the button I am taken to the generic sales page to download the app."
"11/7/19: I've LITERALLY used it for five seconds and this is the best tasks app ever. jesus christ 6/10/20: Still a great app Insanely intuitive, if I say so myself, especially the snooze feature. Awesome."
"It helps a lot, especially with consistently doing things that I want to do daily or weekly."
"Had a great experience when I was using it thru browser but when i installed it on my phone, it wouldnt record all my progress and tasks on my phone application. Even with the same account. Please work it out, I would love to keep using thru my phone."
you basically can't do anything if you don't buy the full version.
Just upgraded to premium version. App and Google play list subscription at $27.99. I got charged $29.84. ???
This is such bad app I have ever used .I buy the paid version of this app but when I open the app it ask me to buy paid version again.Money also deducted from my account and I used paid version for one day but after one day when I open the app it ask me to buy pro version again.. Please resolve my issue or refund my money ...
Loved the App..... Wonderful....
I think the old version is better than the latest version. Hope that there is an option to choose between the horizantal or vertical interface. The shifting of days from left/right is easier than the new one. I barely use the app since the change of interface. Ive been using this for a very long time and it was really helpful.
"Experience after my time on this app, supper detailed, and incredibly smooth. The best part is how convenient the lay out is. My style and ways of doing things changed right after I hit the OPEN APP BUTTON!"
"Great. I would recommend the following features: - Skills. When you work on a task, you could select which skills you will be working on. - A timer: keep track of how long you spent working on a task, and consequently on the skills. This would allow a summary of how long the player spent on each skill. - (maybe?) Skill trees. Being able to create publix skill trees for a project/hobby/etc... would be a very nice feature too."
Ease of use and not overly intrusive... The affirmative encouragements help me to pick myself up again... Great job!
Dashboard/ charts better be inclusive all habits. Not just per one habit. Also download to excel would be nice
I m new to used
Just started using... Looks better than other apps... time changing to be focused more... will revisit after using few days... Thanks team.
Awesome! Use it for all task & list management. Great to use it for work & personal tasks and lists for grocery shopping as well. Love it. My kids love it as well.
Why did you have to ruin a good thing Microsoft. Wunderlist was perfect until you came along. The primary reason why I enjoyed Wunderlist was for it's flawless widget. When you checked off a task from the widget it would simply disappear. But you guys can't seem to do the same thing. Worse part is that your widget glitches out after completing a task (it's more like a 'twitch') like it's trying to get rid of it but can't. Didn't you guys buy the program? Why did you have to change it?
"While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there."
"Nice but it's really irritating that you can't edit frequency! Or a start date but I could live with that. Unfortunately, when your schedule / circumstances change, you have to create a new habit because you can't change days and frequency! EDIT: Thanks guys for the prompt response! Fingers crossed the update with this feature is released soon! 🤞"
"I personally would like to add to this app, if I had a chance is change how the entires were set up. You had to make up the name. But it would make it better if it had a date and name. To me it feels like something you can do on a piece of paper. Add more cool features that you can't find anywhere else."
"Used to work really well, now the notifications wont work on my xiaomi phone, rendering ot pretty much useless..and I tried everything"
Great calendar. It's the only calendar I've found that displays a full agenda including a full description of the event etc.
"This app has really helped me get my stuff in order! It also has an active community and good challenges! It is a bit glitchy at times (things don't refresh, etc) but overall it's great! Edit: lol, the 'report a bug' is glitched on my phone :P I had to manually send my info over, in the middle of fixing a glitch where my day won't reset - been broken for a week."
"How can I delete priorities? Someone please answer me. Also, please make a feature where we can choose to check subtasks off through check boxes as well. And a feature that lets us choose the colour of the to do list when it's open, as well. Also, headers within the lists themselves? Just to divide tasks. I will change my rating to a 5 star, then. Thank you for reading this."
Would be nice to have the ability to add more tabs......
Really
It's really good app... I have been using it for few days... Really helpful... Just one thing... When I add a new task it shows up on the top of existing tasks... Can I change the settings so that it will appear at the bottom? That's why given 4 stars...
The app is good but the reminders for some of the habits are not working. I have bought the pro version.
"I don't get task notifications anymore!!! This app has become useless. I have uninstalled and reinstalled, turned on / allowed notifications in the settings yet nothing."
"Plz ???❤1.Widget that shows the current date, list of upcoming events, 1 click option to open calendar 2.Ability to set reminders/alerts for scheduled events 3. Ability to sync to phone's stock calendar (Android) 4.Additional settings ability to customize the color of the circle indicating current date 5. Ability to actually see the inspirational quotes in the app even if a new tab was necessary 6.Ability to create tasks and designate their priority as high, low or routine along with the option"
It's very good application for organising our works and tasks in day to day life which are very important in order to enhance our productivity and progress. The application has almost all the features and facilities to cover the tasks and other relevant details. Thanks to the developer of the application.
"Just Downloaded so far great, but I'm looking for an application I can use between two or more, i.e. minors etc. Where I can send a task via messenger for example. does this app upload if the other user also has Task?"
"Under subtitle *security* ""However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers"" Sorry no thanks.i just downloaded but after reading privacy policy i prefer going thru •Google official •one & app like calendar required lot of access ,&i personally don't wanna bleach my data like this..btw the tq for placing the info it to let us know :)"
the app opens it self up whenever it wants to display an ad but the screen remains the same but i cant press anything. so it just opens up in the background all day long to display ads and make money when im not even using the app. this feature is ridiculous and it started happening every 5 minutes as opposed to every now and then so i just deleted the app.
It's so simple yet soo good. Would love it even more if it has built-in pomodoro feature.
easy to use.
Too many errors.
This app would be great if they would just stop locking people out of premium. This has happened with several users for months and still not fixed. I got a new phone and can't use this app because login with Facebook won't transfer. This is my first one star review I ever gave an app and to say I am disappointed. Just use one of the many other habit trackers.
its good nd loved it but need to more developed
"Still learning how to use it, but so far so good! I like how you can set up daily, weekly, etc. tasks to be recurring so you don't have to constantly re-add them. My one complaint is that setting tasks for specific dates that aren't tomorrow or next week is a bit tricky."
"I like that it is easy and convenience which is what I'm looking for but I 
also need a way to run analytics of times spent on each task. Will change 
to 5 stars if that is possible."
If you are looking for a perfect organiser of your time. This is the app for you. Love it and you will too if you are like me and want some organisation in your life. Perfect!
I love this app Previous issue of being randomly logged out was resolved
This app is amazing. I can keep track of my day and connect my work and personal calendar an see them displayed them in a very colorful presentation. Never schedule two th I'll ngs at the dame time again.
I have set daily reminders. It doesn't show the reminders after few days. Due to which I missed many of activities. For example. I have set bath reminder at 8.30am but it has showed only for 2-3 days. From 4th day it went missing.
Hey. Will there be no reminder function on this app?
It's ok but a bit too simple and the inspirational messages don't change not really very motivating to use this app compared to my previous habit tracker. The App's look doesn't come exciting to look at as well.
"Super cool if you're a dude and want one of the multitude of dude avatars. If you're a woman, I hope you want to be a nun, a woman holding an umbrella over a puppy, or part of a couple. Not even kidding. Definitely a guy created this app and had an all guy panel of betas."
"Widget freezes, app does not sync. I had a galaxy S7 edge and just got an S10+. App fails with both phones. Regret spending money on this."
I use this app daily! I love it! Great job wouldn't change anything
Not as user-friendly as I had hoped. Still accomplishes it's purpose.
"It is good to organise the tasks. The only. Problem is,i am not able to get reminders. I am setting the reminder but it is but showing"
Useless
Its fine
Just using the free version. Has been a major help as a tool along with a habit building book I'm reading. I like!
Not that good after using
Clean layout and does what it says without egregious permissions. Two thumbs. Unfortunately I can't find information about the app's functions even within the help menu: - Recurring tasks do not appear to reset if they are not complete. I can't figure out how to make them reset even if they are incomplete. - I can't make my recurring items show up on the calendar. - I can't manually set the reset time since my tasks might be completed between 8pm and 3 am. - View previous recurring tasks.
So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday)
I downloaded this app many times but every time when i open the app it abruptly stops and I am unable to use it. I am unable to open it because it immediately shut downs as soon as open the app.
I actually loooooove the app and use it to organise my life but it has now stopped updating as a widget. If I make changes to my lists on the app it will not change on the widget?
"BC2 won't sync with Google Calendar. Autosync is enabled, but still, events created or deleted from app will not sync with online calendar or Google calendar app."
"I really want to love this app but it won't even let me select PM so its constantly telling me its past the due date, which makes the app very useless to me."
Absolutely amazing to be able to track both daily habits as well as tasks in the same app. Only thing that would make this the best choice for this purpose is to have a web application to at least be able to add new habits or tasks and mark them as completed. Was previously using todoist for this purpose and just switched to HabitNow ❣️ Some other useful features: - Add a length to a task or habit - Be able to set a time so that tasks and daily habits can be sorted by time of day
"It was decent at first, but it stops working completely when I wanted to put a custom time reminder, and it did not sync with my Google calendar. I ended up deleting it :/"
The app no longer notifies me of my tasks!!! Please fix
"I downloaded this after seeing someone advertise it. Looked cool so I figured try it out, right? Until I downloaded and it prompted me for a subscription. Lady you are nuts. People rather by the paper agenda at the store for cheaper. You do not see the full texture of the book, it's an online planner on top of it. I'm not paying you for that. I downloaded a FREE calendar that does the exact same thing. Terrible marketing skills."
"I really liked this app. This helps me remember things on time but the only problem is that, it doesn't give Pop up or notification sound so every time I've to check my next task."
the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it. very annoying.
"So far, I love this app and the idea behind it. It holds me accountable for my tasks and habits which i really love. I would totally give it a shot."
"The new notifications are atrocious. The don't follow light or dark theme in Android 10, they don't work well with Wear OS, and they turn on my screen when I don't want them to. I'm now getting reminder pop-ups when i don't want any and the option to turn them off is gone. 10/24/2019 - I downgraded to v5.2.3 and got the Reminder Pop-ups option in Settings > Notifications back. When I update to 5.3.0 the Reminder Pop-ups option is replaced with Notifications and Notification Font options."
"It is an OK app as far as personal entries are concerned and the connected functions of name, time and place. Can not count on it to keep you informed about set Calender Events though as they are set default in 2014. Mothers Day was on the 8th; 2nd Sunday in May this year; not Wednesday the 11th. They can thank my wife for keeping me informed. It is a scheduling app and if the default events are wrong as well as uneditable how confusing will your scheduling be? Keep an accurate calendar handy."
Gostava mais do Wunderlist.
It was okay could be better
"I used to like this app because it was like writing in a physical notebook, but that smooth user experience is gone. I feel like they are focusing too much on adding new stuff while the core functionality gets looked over."
I really enjoy using this. Sadly I couldn't find The Cake Tree..though I updated the app. 😣
"Good thing it's free, else who would pay? As a fan of Microsoft products, the development of this app is disappointing. It's nothing but average. If the developers can just pick the top task management apps in the play store and add their features into this Todo app, perhaps the development could be accelerated. But right now, it's just like every other low-end Todo apps available, not robust, not feature rich, not exceptional."
Simple and upto the task
Just another app with a subscription based service.
######please make offline version because most of studious people cannot afford online apps so if you want good ratting please make part 2 offline
"This app is a fantastic idea, but man is it buggy. I'm constantly having to restart the app or check it later because it's bugging out. Would be 5 stars otherwise."
"Pro Version and it still won't handle the recurring tasks smoothly. Please fix it, I've restarted my phone several times and still nothing."
Deep forest button won't work
I m facing the i same issue which kenners79(below comment on 9/6/2020) is facing. Widget issue.
"Super easy to use and it has been a life saver recently. I love the layouts. I wish there was a desktop version, too."
"Really great features, even though it took me a while to understand them. I really like the filtered lists and don't get the point of sublists yet. Pls make tasks repeatable without them having a reminder (you can set ""reminder type : none"" but not ""reminder : don't remind me"")."
It is ok but maby it could be a bit more clear
The widget is feezing after every night
I went on thinking it was easy to put in reminders and stuff but it isn't.You have to buy the full version
i cant set widget on homescreen can you help me plz..
"While i can understand limiting somethings for premium only, i've never seen an app block widgets behind a pay wall and quite frankly this is only useful to me if I can keep track of things on the homescreen. Maybe I would have liked it but so far i havent used it because i keep forgetting its there."
"I can perfectly harmonize my personal and business life with this app for more than two years now. I still can share private calendars with the rest of the family, can decide who sees what and finally what event can squeeze in or not. I use reminders to take me in right time so I need no personal assistent or secretary. Multiple calendars is a must. WELL DONE."
"The in app calendar view doesn't show the tasks I've scheduled. When the devs responded to my 1st play store review, i thought they're going to fix it. But now, even after several updates, it's clear they had not taken my feedback with much seriousness. Uninstalling."
I had a reminder set with a certain sound & it never went off
"Update: After last update HabitNow got even better Problem with habit frequency resolved I increased from 4 to 5***** Great job! Very versatile, keeps you on the track and highlights your strengths and weaknesses So impressed that I bought premium on very first day to have option of unlimited habits"
Very helpful
Not easy to use also not effective
Cute app. Could do with a more user-easy interface for the lazy out there but nice little motivator
Missing an important feature!!! They need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day. It is a must for someone who has ADHD. I would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature.
It takes time burpt good but it keeps getting out like you can't login
"The new notifications in 5.3 suck. They visually look wrong, don't perform well and are a huge step backwards. Would love to see a reversion to the system notifications rather than custom."
How is it possible to be unable to restore my data?
the app requires premium membership to use the widget. defeats the point for me
"Looking as everyone else's very +ve reviews. I seem to be the odd one out but I didn't find it straightforward. It is too easy to delete a list (on my S9 at least) with even a slight bit of a swipe. Once deleted it is lost. Why not have a 'back' or 'undo' button? Personally I don't find the heading, group, list structure particularly straightforward although I've now got used to it."
This is my favourite personal todo apps after going through so many to-do apps. I like the calendar view that link with Google calendar. All events can be added direct in the apps. I use this apps calendar view a lot. They improve a lot from time to time especially recently with the natural language which make me even more productive. Like the web app as well. The support they give when facing issue also very professional. It sure a 5 stars apps that suit my needs.
I got just scam. Rs. 200 for pro version. Nothing happened. Good times.😒
Great app..but one suggestion..if you could add the feature of marking whether or not we followed a particular activity in the routine..that would be great.Like if I've planned to study..I can mark whether or not I actually studied.and then it could show the statistics of how much I stuck with my routine.please consider it.also you could add a goal tracker..Love your app.
"Awesome App.... BUT, soo many bugs!!"
Good
Too useful and organized
Love your hard work. But it's there a widget? With the calendar open?
"pretty app and probably useful too, I just don't like having to create calendar entries. I thought tasks would be managed within the app"
Loved this app until it stopped syncing... My android app and web app have been out of sync for over 2 weeks
"you should have name to change date with ""yesterday"" ""today"" ""tomorrow"" (not number) on widget view"
This is so rad. It's so easy. This works with my brain. I made all the lists and categories on my laptop and now I just add to them as needed on the app.
I love it its so mofeda
"very simle with few functions, maybe for childrens. there are missing a lot of usual functions that others free app have: time tracking, a true calendar where you add tasks by minutes steps, no task, subtask numbering, no tabel, spreadshets tasks, no custom fields, no timesheet , etc on this premium account. If you want and work with advanced GTD, planners, project management go away and dont lose your time."
Does exactly what it is needed for.
"The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you."
Just a list app. You can't do anything else unless it's on a list.
This is really a great app. I'm just finding difficult to put tasks in home widgets. Could you tell me how to do this?
I don't miss Wunderlist. This app is great. The only thing it doesn't have is integration with Google Assistant. That would be great. Otherwise this is super.
"Want to know that is there any feature like wunderlist app, to get notification of comment on all shared members on their app as well as on email."
"Highly user friendly, but the free version lacks some of the useful features..."
I don't like this app because...no protecting from this app..
"User Interface is so tough, specially for a new person.. Even there is no guide that how to use.. On front there r those things which r not useful for a working person like those Xp and all.. Don't know how to find week date or tym for an alert.. Not impressive.."
"Works okay if you're looking for routine alarm, but not exactly as a motivation and control of routines."
Amazing. Love it. I can keep track of my daily and to do tasks and reward myself by seeing my character grow and level up and I can buy him new things with the coins I earn from doing tasks. The only bad things is that the game relies on honesty. There's nothing stopping you making many tasks and just ticking them off to the get Gold rewards.
"dont like the layout, not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced. don't recommend. there are much better apps that cost much less or are free."
"I love this app and use it for everything, however, for some reason it is no longer showing any holidays when I clicked on that tab. Hopefully this will be fixed in the next update."
The ads are to loud and in your face.
Nice app
I've premium version but I'm still bombarded with adverts. Also try to make this app a little bit more interesting and fun to use. Change the ugly colour scheme
It crash. The time when I needed it the most:(
"Devloper add all the features of Google calender apart from this app features. I request to your team devloper to incorporate the lawyers dairy for court cases updating facility as per client, court type etc in calender, then it will awesome and more useful. 🙏"
the widget freezes a lot. the calendar is not intuitive to use.
Simple and easy to manage. Sync with other devices.
"It is not syncing properly between my husband and I. In fact, it won't sync at all. It did in the beginning and now it just won't. Really miss wunderlist! It was simple, easy to use and it WORKED!"
"Not a bad app pretty good, got a few things organized with it."
"Very confusing, only the creator knows..."
Good
"Absolutely terrible. I have a 30 something list of daily tasks to keep track of that are set to repeat. It was very tedious & time consuming to set up with in the first place, but after several days at random points some items would not renew. Not all at once and no discernible pattern as to the tasks it stopped renewing. They show that they are still supposed to repeat daily and they were last checked off several days ago, and will not show up on the list for today. 0/5 stars"
i had added a routine & by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from today's date... i m unable to change the date... it's frustrating...
"The latest update is terrible. I always organized everything by date of the reminder, which is usually set on the day that it's due, but now I can't even see the due date of each task. I have to click on each task for the the date to appear. In addition, I usually organize each task by tags, the date, recurring if needed, and other details. There's no easy way to adjust all these details anymore. You have to click on each separate icon to fix these to what you want. I use the app begrudgingly."
Initially I liked the app very much...After that.. Some times when I try it open it's not open and keep on showing forest keeps stopping .. So I unsinstalled it and installed again.. After few days experienced same problem.. I thought if I buy proversion this will be fixed.. But evne after buying I'm again experiencing the same problem.. Very disappointed
"Stable.Works on Android ,PC and Apple devices"
"I wish it was offline, like people may not have an internet connection always and it will be a little annoying to see that you can't move forward without internet. Also I can find an option to repeat my to do list . Like in Google task you can set a time for it to remind you what to do and also you can make it repeat. It's sad that a app like this doesn't have such a basic thing."
"Having problems. The app is not syncing anymore with my Google calendar. I double-checked the settings gs and permissions and tried to force a sync, still no good. It is set to auto sync every 3 hours. Edit: changed from 3 to 4 stars. I appreciate the suggestion to try and help. It didn't fix the issue. However with my new phone the app is working seamlessly. Very easy to use, lots of customization, visually easy to read. Thanks."
Love this app! Just wish I could use it on my surface pro as well as my phone.
"Didn't used to be a good replacement for Wunderlist, but now it's close. Navigation and UI are great, lists are very useful and easy to organize. My only beefs are lack of control over notifications for shared lists (notification every time a list item is added, completed, etc.), and with Wunderlist you used to be able to invite people to a shared list without using a 3rd party app if they were already a user... annoying to have to text/message links when i've previously shared lists with..."
It's been a good app but I can't sign in now. I can't even renew my premium membership. I love this app but it's been like this for long. You will always be redirected to the sign in page everytime you sign in
Enjoying it
"Would like to assign priority rating to each task (A=do it soon, B=do it later, C=low priority, Z=take it off the list)"
"Best tiny investment ever!!! I have been using this app for many years. Over time I have trialled new calendar apps 'for interest sake' and have found there is nothing that is as customisable, easily edited or functional to manage both personal and work related events, appointments and tasks all in one place. Keep up the great work APPGENIX."
I enjoy this app because I am a task oriented person and I can see how much I have completed and the XP gaming quality to it makes me feel like I m reaching for a goal with immediate gratification not just doing work
Still exploring the app but so far so good
Great app. Does things easily. Maybe a video of effective usage would help.
Useless and time consuming. Got pro version but no option for refund
Not advisable to anyone.
"overall a really good app. well thought. however, I would personally spend some time on the interface/interactions. it became too many steps for my preferences. realizing I needed to change a bunch of tasks, I had to pick a task, bottom right to edit, then tap below description, untick termless, select date, click ok top right, another ok top right. that's too much. I suggest adding swiping options to the task (look at nine email as an example). but overall good. might return one day :)"
"Been a user of the app for 5+ years. Has been helpful in managing a busy life. Up until recently would have given 5 stars. Three stars because of poor app support. I think I have finally worked out my issue, but disappointed in level and responsiveness of support. Just hope you never need support."
This app is the simplest thing yet it makes such a big difference in my daily life. I would only add the option to see the details of each task on the widget (right now it opens the app by default which is not a major issue but It would be an improvement). Thank you for making my life easier!
"I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot."
"Best app to manage my time, Seeing the size of my tasks helps my mind Be sure that it can do it"
"Relocate the *Delete Task* & *Mark as Done* tabs. I have a Galaxy Note 10+, and, quite likely w/ other phones, when i motion to press my *navigation button* on the bottom right or the *open application button*, on the bottom left, i am frequently accidentally tapping the *mark as done* or *delete task* tabs and have to to manage or recreate my my task details that I was already working with. Aside from being increasingly frustrating, aggravating, and annoying, this becomes a time waster."
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad
"Paid version probably is good, but.... free version is seriously restricted. Does not live up to reviews, which I am now guessing are mostly premium users. A simple example, reminders cost. 4 colors included, but a simple other one costs. Etc"
"I only really use this as a to-do list after wunderlist stopped. This app is good. You can easily share and print lists. There is a lot more to it, but for my needs it is perfect. Only downside is that you need a MS account to use it, this is so it can sync to your pc.some people might not like this, bit it doesn't bother me. Edit: now that you can group lists together, this app is great."
I purchsed this specifically for the pomodoro feature (among other features). It's not included in the app.
Loved this app until the recent update. In order to access deep focus mode I have to grant permissions for the app I don't feel comfortable with granting and I she never had to grant these permissions before. Without granting these permissions the app is rendered useless/ a fancy timer and I'm now looking for a similar app which won't be so intrusive on my privacy. Buying the pro version was a waste of time. Two stars for what it used to be otherwise it would be one.
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub."
Great app
I did like the app..after I'm reinstalling the app..what happens to my In app purchase..I had purchased the app..Rt now which I'm using is it the paid one or free one. Do I need to pay for premium again??
"The concept is inventive, but the execution simply makes this app less than enticing to use."
I really love the idea this app has but it has some bugs. The first 2 pages are blank and when i had to make my character everything was blank too. After updating the app it was still the same. (Im using a samsung s8 if thats important) Hope you guys fix it cuz i'd love to use the app.
I really enjoy this app up until about an hour ago. all of a sudden during a quest my party disappeared and my friends messaged me to ask what happened. I have also tried to join a help guild to ask but the app wont let me join a guild or post in chat at all now. please fix this bug so me and my friends can enjoy the app.
Awesome app. I love how detailed it is. The only other thing I can think of right now is to be able to talk to it and have it help you put what you want in the best place
"Used to be great, now it's awful. I use the Widget the most, and have it set to Important to see all my Tasks, not just 1 or 2 per day. Unfortunately, the widget reverts to 'My Day' every time I boot up my phone, and won't switch back. I have to remove the widget from my home screen, then re-add it & switch list to Important - every day! Today was the 5th day of doing this, and I got fed up, so switched to Google Tasks, which is now a much better app than it used to be, & better than To Do."
"Not working properly , don't delete immediately any routines ,"
"*Update* 11/02/20 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! As expected, no contact from developers. App has not been updated since 2018. This app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone. A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed."
Easy to use - Effective - Among best apps I've ever downloaded. Thanks.
"I like its simplicity and overall functionality. I've been using it for a while. I just purchased the pro version to promote support to developer. Just a little favor, hopefully, we can see the events synced from Google calendars in Events tab and preview the events & routines for the days ahead. Thanks :)"
"The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work"
Quite disappointed with this app. Is used to be fine for past years. Currently is really slow when checking my task and is so frustrating at times. This app need improvement on the server and at times server down :(.
i love this app so far but the notifications are not really working for me
It is a super app. I wouldn't forget my activity
"I really like the idea of this app, however you'rer not allowed to use lot of useful features unless you pay! and that's upsetting :/l"
For now am on love the the app is very very efficient
"The old navigation was better, especially on desktop. I miss being able to edit directly, now I have to go through more steps."
"1) Inside the task edit window, you can't move a task to another list. 2) When moving a task, you can't quickly create a new list – you need to go to the main screen, create the list and then return to the task and move it... 3) When you open a task through the widget and delete it or just close, you will be thrown into the app. It would be much better if the task window (which was opened from the widget) would just close. 4) You can't add or remove a couple of selected tasks to My Day."
my mobile is getting switched off after installing.it worked fine on 1st day of installing. please fix it
While swiping towards right the tasks are getting deleted. At least it should ask for confirmation whether the delete is happening accidentally or we really want to delete.
Awesome app very helpful and does its purpose very well. Just wish it was free or a one time purchase.
Quick Add got fixed. Now the sync is broken.
This app is being killed in the background whatever i do. I have given all the permissions. But still it is being killed. My phone is oppo A5. Please do something Devs.
"This is a good app with somewhat helpful widgets. The widget calendar should include tasks on individual days. Events and their notification settings are lacking. If I want to be notified 2 weeks in advance, I simply can't.. In Google Calender, I can set it 4 weeks in advance. With this app I have to set the event date 1 week before it happens and set the notification to 1 week in advance in order to get 2 week notice. These restrictions are a dealbreaker."
"JUST PURCHASED MONTHLY SUBSCRIPTION. UNTIL NOW, MY APP IS NOT WORKING AS A FULL VERSION."
Edit: Still doesn't work. I suggest adding proper integration with Outlook because it is leaps and bounds ahead of Google in terms of usability and ease. - Before Edit: Doesn't show me the events already listed on my Outlook calendar. Every day is blank. When I go to add an event with only Outlook calendar selected it wants me to add an event into another calendar. I don't care about adding events (I can do it on another platform) but if can't even see my Outlook events then this is useless. Gave it all necessary permissions and checked dates and synced.
Good for a long time but recently it became unusable...it would always freeze up.
It keeps me accountable 😁
Now I'm using this app when I used this app I ll tell you .
"I have a big problem with this app, daily routine doesn't repeat unless i complete it. But somtimes i really could not complete it. then ist stop, why?!!!!"
"I need help, party and guild is buggy for me. Only a blank page is displayed if i open that. Pls fix this"
"Pros: this app is very similar to the functionality of Wunderlist and adds features I wanted. Free version is fully functional except for the limitation of 9 lists Cons: Some of the widget buttons are small and I am not a fan of subscription services for premium features (I would pay a one-time fee, even for each upgrade, but i absolutely won't subscribe)"
This is a very good app... just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice.
I'll give it five stars when the widget stops resetting to nothing after I alter things within the app. I have to delete it off of my screen and put it back on in order for it to update.
Some daily tasks just disappear a minute after I tick them. This bug is affecting me for about a week now and I'm already tired of it.
"not bad, still new user tho"
"I need help, party and guild is buggy for me. Only a blank page is displayed if i open that. Pls fix this"
"Auto-fail only works if you go to each task? That's not auto fail. Makes no 
sense. Might as well go back to Life RPG. that feature was the only reason 
I even tried this. Subscription model ridiculous. Why would I pay a MONTHLY 
fee for some icons? They are helpful icons & necessary mostly, but that's 
just ridiculously expensive for some icons. A one time fee is reasonable. 
Even if it was like $5. I wanted to like this app, but this got in the way."
"I used to love this app but since installing the latest version on my new Samsung 10 the Google Tasks sync has stopped working. It synchronises from Google to Business Calendar but will not synchronise from Business Calendar to Google. ] I have tried disconnecting my Google account and reconnecting, I've made sure BC2 Tasks is associated with my Google account and all Sync settings are turned on. Is this is a known issue and if so will a fix be developed please? Thanks."
I wish more options be available to free version
So far this is the best app I have used to plan for my hw and studiesas it is very easy to set and plan the things you want .I highly recommend you to try this app.
"Works great for my needs, I love it!"
"I think that this is a great idea, but it’s one better suited for a larger screen.  A lot of display real estate is utilized to (beautifully) display a very limited amount of information."
I enjoy the app but for some reason the end noise once my trees are planted no longer happens apart from that I enjoy the reward of planting for tasks a d seeing the results
"We need an update!! I love this app and use it daily but the fact that we haven't had an update in months bothers me. Here are some suggestions I have: add a settings option to default the amount of time you spend on a task (I use 45 min.), more color options for tasks, an option to change the notification sounds for each entry, a 'push all back an hour' option, and more widget options! Thank you I love this app but we could definitely use some upgrades!"
"I love this app! It has helped me become so much more productive and organized. Any time I think, ""I should do ..."" I just add it to my Any.do! [Would rate 5 stars, except I hate that the Upcoming list is automatically bumped up to Today after a period of time, and it also continuously logs me, which is not only cumbersome, but renders the widget useless for that time.]"
"Not sure why but it doesnt seem to alert you or at least does intermittently after its first alert. For example I had a habit to check a website every day at 11:00 to check for updates, it worked the first time however I get no other updates thereafter. Not much ise if theres no consistency."
خیلی جامع و تفصیلی بود.
"I bought this app in IOS , just want to use full version without pay it again. I just change phone .T-T"
A today section for this app is so necessary. I add all my tasks to my day. But the next day there was nothing in my day!!! And in today ooption in my day it says there is no task but then there is 2 tasks for today!!! What's going on????
Costs money to make pixels darker
I really like this app. But I stopped using it because it's too hard to type out my entire routine on the app. I wish it was windows compatible.
"This used to be my favorite To Do app because I could easily set up my tasks on the PC then track them on my phone, or add them on the fly. The only problem is now that I wanted to use Widgets they are blank half the time. I will be looking for a new To-Do app so I can use widgets. Phone: Samsung Galaxy S8 - Android P"
"I really like the application so far. Great interface and feature set. I'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set. I think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too. Even better if the group can collapse. It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive. Have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that. Overall a great application, I hope you continue working on this application.  Edit: The app is still decent, but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating."
Ok but doesn't feel too user friendly and kinda weird that the calendar is behind a paywall
TimeTune has made scheduling my tasks easy. I can edit my schedule whenever I want to and can keep track on my daily tasks. Thank you TimeTune😊👍
"ট্যাবে হরাইজন্টাল, ফোনে ভার্টিকাল। ফলে ট্যাবে লিখতে অসুবিধা হচ্ছে। এবং লগ ইন করতে হয় যেকোন অ্যাকাউন্টে।"
"OMG! I have never been so irritated by an app. It worked once and then again started to crash, I reinstall it, again and again and again. Everyday i when I wanna use the app I have to reinstall it. Why develop such a nice app which is of no use. Very very disappointed!!"
"I really loved this app. It has everything I wanted. But I feel like there is still room for improvement in this app, it's my personal opinion though, It will be better if you could add a screen for the heat map and that heat map would be colored on the days when user did at least one task, another one could be letting user add notes for subtasks also. 🙏"
Uninstalled as calendar events keep appearing under the wrong date. Disappointing.
"Notifications do not show up. Thought I have enabled all permissions and to override dnd, the notifications and reminders do not work."
"This app is horrible it was working well at first but when I tried to edit my list titles and add more lists but, it never worked no matter how many times I tried, and trust me that was many, many times. This app is very annoying and over all very useless."

"App seems okay, but I created like 5 habits and then was told to upgrade to the premium version. Not cool."
no comments
"This apps not suitable for my needs. The reminder keep show every day, even the task mark as 'Done' (everyday I do click 'Done' at reminder, the next day, and next day, and next day, the reminder still come up). The logic for the apps does not make sense for me (I'm not a paid subscribber)."
I love Habitica. It works to make the things I have to do at least somewhat rewarding and I can set fun goals for boring tasks.
"Bug: message cannot be displayed on app! Android 9, nokia 6.1 plus"
"May 22, 2020 - updating to 5 stars, this app is my go-to. Easy to use, pleasing UI, and sharing is easy. Also, thanks for listening and responding! Was a 5, dropping to 3 after last update. Separating completed items would be fine (though less tidy visually than hiding), but sort orders now don't apply to completed items. Grocery lists become much more tedious, as you have to now either search through an unsorted list or type every grocery list item again from memory."
Integrates nicely with all calendars
Desktop widget stops functioning every minute!!
Just started using. Can't figure out yet how to delete completed tasks instead of moving or crossing them off.
"I recently switched over from the original business calendar app which I have been using for many years. This version has a fancier UI but functionally seems much the same as far as the calendar goes which is fine, if it ain't broke don't fix it! I think other features have been added but I don't really use them. Update: full screen ads suck. They appear and cannot be closed for a long time. Show me an ad if you must but let me close it, the free version is unusable this."
Don't bother installing this app. The free version is garbage. Recently the developer made the decision for inclusion of ads. The ads pop up every time you add an event to the Calendar. The developer has chosen to sacrifice usability of the app and consumer comfort in the rush to monetise the app. I have uninstalled it and will not be returning to the app again.
"This is by far the best to do list app I've come by. It has rich features and a great interface, even in the free version. It knows the difference between a task, and a habit. My main issue here with the app, is premium pricing. Why exactly do I have to pay a monthly fee for features that can be used offline? Normally, a monthly subscription is to support features that need to be consistently paid for. From what I can see, there's only one. If a one time payment option is added, I'll buy it."
"Incredibly well thought out and designed. So grateful I finally found a tool so perfect for my needs. I was starting to think maybe I was setting my standards too high or didn't know clearly enough exactly what I was looking for but nope, this is as close to perfect as I think anyone could ever ask for. Been a premium user for probably about a week, and I chose to leave this review on my own without being asked. Thank you, for creating this tool!"
its serves a purpose
"It's pretty useless, google does a better job"
"There could be any difference between gold that we earn. If my rewards are ""cheat meal"" and ""netflix episode"" and tasks are ""run 10 km"" and ""read a book"", it shouldn't be able to get a cheat meal reward for reading a book..."
Great program! It keeps me organized. I label my categories after days of the week. Then I organize my days by puting my todos as subcategories. What ever one's I can't accomplish this program has a feature that allows my to move it.
"Hi, I just started using this app a few days ago and I'm absolutely blown away. It's kept me on track for a bunch of my activities and the UI is so customisable while being clean. I have a minor suggestion about if progress bars to recurrent activities can be added? Eg. I'm reading a book and have that as a recurring task but I'd like a slide bar to be able to advance my progress daily. Subtasks don't show in the widget as well. This app is still amazing and great work on everything so far!"
It keeps crashing on my android device. In every 24 hours i have to uninstall and reinstall the app to use it. The error message pops up stating that this app keeps closing.
"There is no way to use deep focus mode which is the whole point of this app. Every time I try to turn it on it says "" please enable 'certain' phone permissions to use "" yes that's very helpful thank you."
i used to love this app..... but now it has been ruined..... made things more complicated and v can't assign according to days of week....
"It loses what you've written for a task if your thumb hits anything apart from the keyboard while writing. its pissed me off multiple timea. Also, the reminding scheme is ineffective. sometimes I don't think it reminds me at all; it's just a notification, it gets mixed in with all the other emails and Facebook blips."
"Best task manager on the market. The ONLY weak points are sub-task handling and sorting on some views, but otherwise fantastic. Queries, fast entry etc. second to none."
"used this app on my old device and it was good. and then i change to a new phone and the app crashes every time it says that "" Forest updated "" although i didn't enable the auto update function. i'm very disappointed because i already bought the premium. fix it please."
would give 5 stars but locking the aync function through a subscription sucks
I've never enjoyed accountability before this... Our whole family partied up and is having a blast PLAYING to do chores. Wonderful concept!
"-When editing or deleting a recurring task it should ask if you're doing it just for this task or all recurring tasks, instead of deleting and editing all tasks without asking. 2- when creating a recurring task I should be able to time it on different times for each reccuring day, instead of having to create the same reccuring task for each seperate day"
"Friend was permabanned for calling another friend a ""mad c**t*"" in party chat, but here in Australia that's a compliment... TL;DR over-sensitive language filter, should allow party chat to be unfiltered."
"""Hey, want most of the features of our app? Then you'd better pay us $30 a year!"" -this app Response: *laughingly uninstalls and writes this review so I never mistakenly download this again* Just greedy! ""But our on-going server costs!"" I don't need cross-platform sync, and that's not an excuse to hold basic features like notifications and start-of-day planning hostage. Consider a 1-time unlock for all non-server featues and we can talk."
"Functional, not beautiful. Nothing particularly advantageous compared to other calendar apps."
"Great app and I totally love it. But recent deep foucs mode asks for permissions which makes me uncomfortable. Like access to all my notifications including my messages, ignoring battery optimization to allow app to run always in the background. These are my main concerns."
"I wanted to love it. And I did, until I needed to add my other Gmail accts to it. Damn near IMPOSSIBLE. I am currently in the 2 wk trial. I reached out to tech support asking for an explanation on how to sync my other accounts, as all of the app tutorials didn't mention how. They sent me back a link to a FAQ telling me WHAT to do, but not HOW to do it. Every Google search had me come up short. I give up. Cancelling. My default calendar syncs em all just fine. Wish I had the pretty stickers, etc."
Devs tried to send me a link in the review comments which I can't even copy let alone open from my phone because their apps is too unintuitive to use without a manual.
Easy n compatible
"Couldnt create an account, wouldnt let me past the setting up account page"
"June2020 updated review....working great, does what I needed from it, great job (not sure why it went nuts last year but thought I'd give it another go....so glad I did) Nov2019 Used this app ages ago, loved it, got it back again last week but now I hate this app because it no longer works with my Samsung Gear Fit2 Pro. Deleting....for good...not happy"
Zero integration with any calendar so literally worthless!!
If u want to study you need to plan DON'T USE APPS
"Could be a lot better. I wish we were able to check off items in our 
routine as we finish them so we can move on to the next task. I would also 
like to see a timer associated with the routines so we can see if we are 
falling behind or are ahead of the time we have budgeted. I have my morning 
routine, but it has multiple tasks within it. If we were able to condense 
my tasks into the routine, it would make things look more organized. All in 
all a very good app if you want to stay organized, but I don't think I 
wouldn't use this app until the mentioned points are added. If these all 
exist already, please let me know- because I couldn't figure out how to get 
to them"
"it's really unresponsive. I have to tap 3 times so something opens or to check a box or anything..  too bad, I really liked it but this is too annoying."
A must for an orgazied life ... digital log book
100% Good and Productive App For Indian 🇮🇳 And Love Taiwan not China
"Very useful, great clock widget with my schedule. It is better if can open calendar app by touched widget."
"Hello, I recently shifted to a new phone. I have a premium membership. But I am unable to transfer my data to the new phone. Please help!"
Everything it expects you to pay
"I lost all of my notes, and it wouldn't accept my passcode to get in any more so I deleted it and installed it again, then logged in and all of my stuff was gone. Please help, I need it back."
"Guys, This is Chinese origin copy of Wunderlist app which is Free of Cost & here they charge claiming for premium features. Not Worth!!"
It comes as a widget on my phone so I can make it really big or put is small in the corner as a reminder. It's really useful!
"The app is good, but I think it's need better graphs and charts."
Just getting used to it but so far not bad
Everything is premium. lots of useful things are premium and you actually have to buy them. everything except that is good.
"The concept has had an extremely positive effect on my life. However I am experiencing bugs with the widgets, where exercises are disappearing. Restarting hasn't helped."
Hard to use
"I missed something very important because this app didn't notify me. The phone ran out of battery in the night - the reminder was set to 8am - and I turned on the phone at 9am. Apparently, to this app, that means to just not tell me that the reminder was supposed to go off. Garbage. This literally didn't do the one most important thing it's supposed to do."
Was using contacts + but ran out of space with an upgraded version so without warning it stopped saving contacts. Poor idea!!! Found Business Call 2 pro & am still discovering new features. Amazing app!
This is tivan China's aap 🤬🤬🤬🤬
"Lately, doesn't sync between web app and Android reminders well. Still a nice app, but that is an inconvenience."
Alarms and notification is not working ...even after battery optimization being disabled...checked all the settings
"App has definitely improved since my last review! more social features would be really cool. i am subscribed and i would love to see where this app takes off. i have noticed recent stability issues when i'm on the app for a prolonged period. not sure if it's related to the amount of tasks i have, as i use this app for basically all my tasks, including birthdays. the app will slow down and nearly crash after awhile. otherwise, this is still my go-to! 4 stars again!"
Useful to make qiuck notes about daily activities.
"This app was AMAZING when I first started using it. Now it duplicates tasks 
too much. I have about 20 of the same task for each day and it takes 
forever for me to delete the extra tasks."
"This app has become my life. I truly love it. It helps me work towards my goals in a very fun&supportive environment. My down points would be (mainly) because of gems. While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game. My problem is that while you can earn them for free, it's damn near impossible to compete with 200+ people in one challenge and get rewarded."
"So far, I love this app and the idea behind it. It holds me accountable for my tasks and habits which i really love. I would totally give it a shot."
It been running kind of slow when you're making new tasks
"Hands down the best todo list / planner app available right now. The free version is more than enough to handle most people's task load. Only when you start to hyper-organize with different sets of lists and categories do you really *need* to get the pro version. And once you get to that level, the $3/mo is well worth the productivity gained."
"Is there no way to assign a specific color to an event? I like to group my meetings by color. If I can't do that, the app isn't useful for me."
I downloaded this app many times but every time when i open the app it abruptly stops and I am unable to use it. I am unable to open it because it immediately shut downs as soon as open the app.
Wish it wou.d sync better to audio all calenders that I have in google
Good app

Having issues with syncing with Google calendar. I added a task on TickTick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my Google calendar. I've tried refreshing but nothing showed up. I've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now. I just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync.
"I loved Wunderlist, and after its unfortunate demise I switched to ToDoist. Have to admit that it is a superior app, but its pricing is a little too much for a to-do app. This one, on the other hand, is free, yet offers much of the same functionality, except for *any* intuitive reminders. What's up with to-do apps and reminders these days? Dear developers, please, I'm begging you, add the basic @time recognition, I'm sure it's something that we've all been missing since Wunderlist."
I LOVE  the idea of the app. Cantake a minute to figure out. Wish it had its own calander or was able to sync with others other than Google calendar.
"App was great, but now I cant set my work end times, only starting due to it being restricted for premium only now after the new update. Bad timing guys. Uninstalling app."
"This is exactly the app I was looking for to visual my day, as the clock face just makes sense. However, only being able to add to the schedule via external calendar apps makes this completely unusable. I tried to use it to better manage my routine, but my calendar app became so full of menial tasks that I was unable to see my upcoming appointments and events of most importance. It has amazing potential, but is currently only good for basic planning. Very disappointing."
Thr notion of paying a monthly fee for this is laughable. I will stick with Todoist for a fre more bucks a month.
"Cant even get past the first screen. I get a notice that my phone is blocking the app, but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel, I've looked all over my settings, there's nothing I can find to change to ""allow"" this app to do something. Frankly I'm dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has, especially as it hasnt told me why."
Love it but would love it more if I could look into the future to see what I have scheduled easily
Useless app... Niether Reminder nor notifications ping... Wasted too much time on ficing issue.. Even followed developer's instructions..
"Would be nice if they'd show you overdue tasks, I missed quite a few tasks because I wasn't reminded. Leaving feedback is hard and annoying, too many extra steps."
Good and user friendly
Can login with facebook because there is an issue with login implementation. Uninstalling
"It was so good and then the PC version became extremely annoying overnight. I'll add tasks in a project, the app will sync and move the task to an entirely unrelated project on its own. And sure, I can reassign it, but I didn't have to before and that's just an annoying waste of time. I don't mind waiting for it to get fixed, but I might just start looking for a new app, which sucks because I really liked this one."
"It's a good app even if you don't go pro, but it is well worth the money if you do go pro. It's very simple and easy to use. Would highly recommend it!"
This is a very good app... just if the shopping list could be shared in watsapp would be very nice.
"It makes auto-copies of tasks. When you delete them, keep showing them again and again. Very annoying."
I love using this app however when I installed it to one of my phones I cannot login to it. It just keeps closing. I don't know what's wrong. Also I wish the widget would contain date and time of the tasks not just tick marks.
Helps me alot
Good app
I downloaded S.Graph but I do not have any widgets with it. I have google calendar. I can open the app but there is no Home screen widget. Any way I can fix that? I have a Samsung S6 Active. Thanks a lot!
Alarm not working .. so no time strict
"Annoying backup system. I've had installed this app and logged in with Google account once. I also tried some of the app's features, but I uninstalled again because of reasons. After some times, I decided to install it again. So I made my tasks and the others without logging in first (because I forgot). Then, when I logged in with my Google account after that, it replace my current data with the older one without warning. Now all my newly created, more complete data is all gone."
"The two starting pages were blank, same as character customization. I saw another comment and there's any new version to update. I was excited to try this app but I couldn't :("
"You don't have to erase your task to delete it. All you need to do is press the completed button and it finishes your work. it even tells how many tasks you have and how many you have done. It's great you should check it out. But best of all is to remember in your mind, it helps your brain."
I just paid for premium as I was told by the app developers that it would enable me to sync my data from my old android phone onto my new android phone. But it fails everytime I click 'sync'. I sent the developers my feedback but they won't get back to me.
"Love this planner. But whenever I use the repeat function, I cant just edit 1 event. I have to edit the rest of the events that are linked together too. Would be great if I'm able to edit jus 1 event even when im using the repeat function. Would also be great if there's a copy and paste of events function! Would make things really easier! 😊"
"Love it, however only problem is that i wish you could plan further ahead by just having more individual calendar dates instead of just 'tomorrow' i think you should be able to plan for every single day,at least 7 days ahead"
"Very good app to help keep and develope new habits! Best gamification of tasks, habits and to do lists!"
"Great app. I don't even play video games but I love the set up of this application, the split into habits, dailies and tasks is perfect. The streaks and rewards are motivational, I like the capability to set reminders and being able to have a task list widget on my home page. I tried a couple other to do apps and none have kept me consistent besides this one."
Is there not a way to open it on a desktop? Please add that feature Update: other apps offer the same feature without making you upgrade to premium - I rather see more ads than have to pay for that simple feature
"I have been using it for years now, but the windows version is still not as perfect as Android version. When I open the windows 10 version of todoist, the app load takes too long"
"I have suceeded 100% and indicates so in the tracker but only says 87% on the app. one of my goals was yoga on Mondays, not sure if it is penalizing me for the other days."
Im giving only 3 stars coz remainders are not working inspite doing all the troubleshooting methods posted in todoist help. Help me
turned deep mode on and it's not working. I'll give it 5 stars when it works again
"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all."
"The new widget does not allow me to open the app directly, like it could before. Updates should never remove features. Knocking my review down - rest of the app is still great."
Key functionalities of the app are hidden behind a subscription of $6.50 per month with the best deal. Simply shameless.
"need ui refresh though,  widgets need to show text on a month view,  theming... etc"
"Update: After I read the reply I redownloaded this app. Waste of $4.25! It's NOT WORTH ANY AMOUNT OF MONEY! Not a lot of extras to charge money AND it's only cute on a computer. The ""lists"" are not very easy to make and I never did find the ""meal plan"" or journal parts. The goal part is not on the app. Any.do is FREE and a lot easier for lists with reminders and also includes a calendar. Not worth the cost. Yeah it's cute but not as easy to use as other free calendars. Pretty disappointed..."
"Really good! I feel it's lacking a dashboard with overall info. Edit: To-do, Accomplished, due, upcoming tasks would be interesting to see in pie chart"
Love your hard work. But it's there a widget? With the calendar open?
"I've been using this as a motivation and self-rewarding To-Do list. It works, and there a lot of communities of people here! Ranging from LGBT to mental illness, it's great."
"i like this app but one thing that i hate , why do i have to be member of premiums ( i mean why do i have to pay ? ) if i want to track up more than 5 habit ? this is a free app right ? please can you consider or change something about it"
"Tick Tick is just hitting it out of the park for me. I originally starting using it because I loved the built in pomo, along with habit tracking. A few months back I got interested in using a kanban board but they did not integrate well with a to do list. Now I see that tick tick has added the option of viewing lists in a kanban style. It is AMAZING. Now it's a truly powerful app that can be a one stop shop for every productivity tool I actually use. I love it!!!"
I don't understand why all the tags disappear once you start pay or join the trial. The only tag showing is Priority. Before I joined premium there were other options which disappeared.
Limited habit data
After purchase of pro version I lost all of my 500+ coins.
"Very simple UI. Potentially too simple and plain but hard to tell without using it for extended period of time, some may like it scaled back look. Can only add 5 habits before having to pay a fee for premium. Hardly enough to actually truly test drive the app before paying. Seems costly for the simplicity of the app."
"This app is a prime example of building a mountain out of a mold hill. The developer does not knot how to make it simple & friendly. The app is very chaotic. Completed tasks do not go away after pressed completed. If deleted from today's list, tasks that have a repeat schedule also disappeared forever. The only reminder this app does right is to remind me how frustrating it is to use. I have uninstalled it on all my phones."
"This app would do better with a calculator tat adds& subtracts shopping List columns with$totals. Also tabs/swipes for delete/retrieve.⁦👍🏾⁩⁦👍🏼⁩UPDATE--2/16/20. 1.You can't edit[actual item]on a list,like change It's name. 2.AND you CAN'T See*or do a running sub total -add or subtract price totals.What good is a list tat when u put the price of a item your Task list can't be more helpful when creating a cost grocery list or whatever,like[hardware store]items list!!! So I deleted"
Loved this app for years. The new full screen ads with no skip option is ridiculous and will likely drive me away. I understand the need for ads but this is too far and I have no need for any of the pro features so I will not pay for it when I can use a different app for free that doesn't block my productivity. I used to recommend this app to anyone who asked but now I won't.
le partage est tres nul.... cest juste un texte envoyé a l autre...
Best organizer out there. Easy to use and has an intuitive layout.
Good
This is worst task game in my life
"Great habit tracking app. The only things I think could be improved are: goal dates not automatically pushing back to match the day you edited a habit. And being able to edit how you want to track a habit if you change your mind. Maybe I missed something, but it seems like you have to recreate a habit in order to change how to keep track of it (ex. Yes/No or by keeping count with numbers). I highly recommend this tool though, it's a great place to start keeping track of habits!"
Highly recommend for you guys!! I installed many apps bt all this is the best one 😍😍
Very good planning app
What happened? Ever since the last 2 updates all my recurring monthly appointment show up for 2 months and then disappear. So now I can't rely on this app to remind me of bills.
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.
"If you want to use dark mode, you'll have to but ""premium"". I understand the need to make money off your app, but thats just scummy."
Its not showing my forest i reinstalled the app multiple times...can u please help?
Good app overall:) 2 Questions. 1st - Is it possible to change the checkoff color to anything else then yellow? (Why would it not be green by default??) 2nd - Why is it not possible to check off the subtasks within the widget?
"Great app. Suggestions : please add options to add tasks hourly. So, +1 to the previous task, could help. Now, most of the apps provide to type the time in chat itself, so selecting the time again manually in this is difficult."
"I love the simple yet intuitive interface. It has a great system of sorting tasks by category, priority, and date. This app truly deserves 5 stars!"
"It's just a widget. They app description made me think it had a lot more features. And don't get me wrong, it might be the best widget I've seen for my calendar. I really think that the description sets the wrong expectations."
Adding Habit Tracker would be useful.
"If it's a passion project I'd be willing to support the creator, but this seems to now be held by just a shell holding."
"After being forced to move from simple and great Wunderlist, after great 4 years of user experience, I was expecting this app to be at least as good as Wunderlist for my need and said let's give it a go. But, of course it's not as good. Only thing that I used Wunderlist for and how I planned to use To Do is one shared list for groceries shopping. First, I imported list from Wunderlist since it has active/unfinished items but couldn't get to have wife join the list after I shared it, so i had to create new list on my phone from To Do, move active items from imported list to this new list, share it and now it works. So, sharing imported list doesn't work. And most annoying is that shared list is not refreshed in widget after some action from another user until app is opened. Since this was the way we used list, through widget, and widgets are there so that we don't have to open app every time we want to do something with the app, if this is not fixed I don't see us using this anymore because I don't want to open app every time I get notification that something changed. Since this was working in Wunderlist I don't see a reason for it not to work on To Do. I checked if app is asking for some additional permissions for this to work, but it's not so I don't see what else can I do."
"It would be higher rating but I can't delite some events I don't need anymore.... For example: I still have reminder to pay a credit card which I don't have anymore for 2 years!!!!! If there is a way of deleting the same, please tell me, I'll give it 4 stars. Also too complicated (time consuming) setting exact time you want a reminder for an event...."
How can i take the notes i have made and copy them over to my laptop. I have looked to see where the notes save to but can't seem to find them anywhere. Please help me
When i share my task on whatsapp Even though i selected share title and content It only shares title Version : 5.2.2 & If i share my task in the form of image the task with long name The end of the name gets replaced with ... Instead of showing the remaining heading on new line
It's a good app I just wish non premium members could set certain apps your not allowed to go on because if you don't have that there's no point in having the app
"This app is very good for keeping on task, and everything is totally customizable. One thing I would improve is the simplisity of it. Right now, it's a bit too much to handle, and if there was an easier way to do things, it would make this app even greater!"
"Unable to subscribe. I am from India. I think this might be the reason. Whenever I click on pay, it shows ""Unavailable for this purchase"". I have tried using different debit/credits cards. Still same issue. If I open in desktop, I can pay using PayPal. But while converting dollar to rupees, it shows more money than it shows me in android app for subscription price. Also I feel, 1300 Bucks for this is a bit pricy. But seeing American economy, and price in dollars, it may be cheap. But here costly"
Really nice. It could have a section for addictions.
Great App...
This app is adorable but i'll never really use it. Its too bland. Great colors and styles just not enough to keep me interested.
I took a star off b/c the alarm for reaching a goal has never worked for me( over 6 months) love the concept of planting real trees. It's not very different from a timer but it does let you keep track of progress in different areas if you use all the features like tags or different trees. I would love if I could see the progress while the tree is growing more visually so I feel like I am making progress but that's mostly b/c my timers are usually set for 2hrs.
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money
"I'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work. Looking at the last update I feel like the developer had abandoned this apps, which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit."
I loved this app. Worked so great I purchased it. Now it has logged me out and says I don't exist.
Stop Adding Groceries Items Like an Ad
Very versatile App that keep me organized with the ability to group multiple categorized tasking lists. Easy to manipulate on the fly and mark off completed tasks.
"Used to love this app, but the new widget is ugly, unreadable, and too easy to accidentally check something. I'll be looking for a replacement if this hasn't been fixed by the time my subscription runs out."
There is no way to edit repetetiveness through ui unless I know the smart commands.
Downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best. This was one of the worst. Played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out.
Why I does not able to add task on a specifically day of every week
"Never use this app, only a little bit!"
"I liked it when I first got it several years ago. But after installing it on several devices, I found it does not sync with the other instances of it. After getting no response from their support desk, I uninstalled the three apps from the three devices and reinstalled them using my google account in case I had not logged in with the same account on all. The three new instantiations do not sync. The help desk is non-existent. The idea is good but the app is defective."
Good
Y doesn't the reminder work!!! I m trying m trying changed all my settings according to this and it doesn't work at all it doesn't remind me i tried and set a particular time and i was waiting but it didn't i m fed up really this made me more anger than ever🤧🥵😶😶😶😶😑😑😑
"I love this app, it's the only one that looks and feels like the old Franklin planner, however; since the latest update I have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with Google ads and I am a paid pro user. This is extremely annoying. If they don't remove this, I'm leaving."
It would be much better with an ability to have a report at the end of the month as to what was worked on and when. Ie statistics.
"Widget freezes, app does not sync. I had a galaxy S7 edge and just got an S10+. App fails with both phones. Regret spending money on this."
Drain too much my battery
"Best app for planning out your days/week. Simply amazing! Also, I think a little tutorial at the beginning might be useful, so that the user would understand how everything works! (In fact I had some troubles understanding how to use the tags and set a routine lol) but after a while you will understand everything, and realize how simple and wonderful this app is! Thank you Edit: I totally missed the ""Help"" button where the tutorial is indeed present! Sorry :)"
"I went a got the full subscription and I really like it so far, but I wish you could download it for your PC as well."
"Your app does not allow to block apps for free. Then there is no use of the app. We would still take up mobile phones if we are addictive to our phones. We are not here to grow trees, we are here to reduce addiction with the help of trees and it is not possible to study without blocking apps and we also need a few apps to study also. Plz fix it I would surely give 5 stars."
this app is just what I have been looking for - it really feels like a paper planner.
Really remarkable app.
This app is absolutely nice app but problem with this app is it shows app stopped after some use and this happened every time with this app only don't know why ?
I love this calendar but a few monthly ago they started adding pop up advertisements when I add an item to the calendar. Very disappointing
"This could be the best planner app out there.  But there are some questions I've not had answered (because inquiries to the developer were unanswered)  such as... can tasks be set to repeat IE, daily,  weekly, etc. Maybe that is in the paid version, I don't know.  The tasks are separated and I'm not sure I can see all of them at the same time.  I'd also like to know if it can sync between Android (Note 4) and iPad.   For now I am using Opus Domini  on iOS, but it is unavailable on Android.  Still searching"
Was working fine before. . But it's not working now..not registering my events
Sends you really annoying emails saying you have zero things to do on your task list or an amount. Even after you uninstall the app it still sends you this unwanted junk. Have to reinstall and delete account.
"Honestly great. Simple. Effective. 1 time purchase. The UI has a sort of dated look but it's very quick and easy to use. Most of my daily habits vary alot based on which day it is, my schedule varies so much I cant put them on a specifik time, and I almost always do them in the same order. Therefore there should be an option to change the order of the habits manually, yourself, without any variables. :)"
i really didn't understand the interface and its too complicated ...
Widget offers the perfect interface for time management and it integrates a number of calendars seamlessly.
"Like the app, but wish it had widgets to be able to see calendar at all times"
It is given reminders
I'd say it's great
"Maybe implement something that categorises and levels up specific areas, such as creativity, language, programming, DIY, home, gardening, hygiene, fitness, culinary skills etc. Everything seems to just bundle into general exp."
Worst
"Very tempting appl, the the theme is geat, however, using preset handwriting styles might be a bit risky."
"I use it for keeping track of tasks after I complete them. I don't want a reminder of a task,I just need to keep track of it. This app allows me to disable reminders. Keeping track of them is as easy as checking off the day. It has the days circled based on how you schedule your tasks. The user experience is really easy. You can create multiple tasks (or habits to be), schedule them separately and keep track of them on one home page. It shows you stats etc to see your progress. Those for whom the reminders cause unnecessary stress (i.e. workout reminders), this app is better than calendar scheduling."
"Looks polished app but time after time new issues come up. Raising these issues with the developer rarely gets timely response or interest in fixing it (I'm a paid user). Today, tasks lost their subtasks on one device, while the 2nd device is OK (for now) || to devs: Task (and their subs) used to sync across devices via Google Drive.. Seems like you eliminated this feature by switching to Google Tasks in your recent update. Totally useless app now for me (at least)"
The problem is the phone is not ringing even though Ring is turned on. Output is given Alarm Volume. Yet Its not ringing..
ok. its useful
"Touch & go, plus Google Assistant stated: it's not support with devise (integration). I'm using a Android phone and have the app on it."
"It's pretty cool app, very convenient to customer everything. And really immerse into the game which is your life"
"I wanted to play with it for a few minutes before putting in my payment info. I realize I can cancel, but would prefer to do a quick test first. I"
"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think."
No monthly recurring reminder features. Can't even remind me when to pay the bills!
Won't do recurring tasks. Does not connect to Gtasks as shown in the cover photo. Hasn't been updated in a long time
Good app
okayish
will not be using ever again.
I love this widget!! It's such a clear picture of the time and schedule!! My only thing is I wish it was compatible for the galaxy watch! I got the app because I saw it on the watch I'm the pictures but it doesn't work with the galaxy watch. 😕 If this was improved to work with the watch I would give it 5++ stars.
"An app the puts me on the, with Todoist I break down big aims into small tasks per day helping me enjoying the progress Its the best out there, after I've tried several"
"Confusing. Used to be better long time ago, not anymore. Confusing usability."
would be nice to once you delete one thing that it would not ask if it's the series.
No doubt this app is amazing. And this app deserve 5 star but I am frustrated because this app doesn't keep log more than 90 days. I wish it could kept forever.
Nice app
"I like the app/ widget, i wish the center was a lil bigger or bold. I havent had an issue withit, other than that."
New layout and functionality is no bueno. Don't like the interface for rescheduling tasks. Please fix!!!
It's better
well I just got it and attempted to.create an account and after unfilled out the info it would not submit it. what gives
Its a very good app...the only issue thats what i am facing is the reminder thing..it dont used to send me reminders and it only notify me when the app is opened. However i have already given all the notification rights. Dear any.do team kindly look in to the matter or advise me if i have missed something with respect to notification settings. Thanks
I've been using BC1 for years and I've installed BC2 on at least 2 seperate occasions. BC2 is so not as good as BC1. The overall look makes it look like a cheap childs game. The functionality became nonsensical and it made going back to BC1 such a pleasure. I can't imagine what the developers were thinking when making such changes. After using BC1 for so long I had high hopes for its future development but alas it not to be. These days I'm looking elsewhere.
"Its the best To-do list app there is on play store! I have tried almost all the highly rated todo list and planner apps on play store, so far this one stands out. It has all the features one can feel required. Must give it a try. Also it gives lot of features in its unpaid version itself, which is pretty cool!"
"Awesome habit tracker, I like that you can go back in time to track a habit you've already started."
"Awesome app! A bit ad-heavy, but functional and pretty."
Its actually very useful. Even without the premium mode and I reccomend it to anyone who has issues keeping track of everything. definitely the best planner I've used and miles ahead of Google Calender and other similar calendar tools. Definitely deserves a 5 star rating. .
"You've had all this time since you started ""fresh"" when you couldn't make Wunderlist do what you want and you still have syncing issues. Write some goddamn integration tests. Syncing should be the most basic functionality that you focus on since without it the app is actually useless."
"Not the bloody annoying calendar/task widget thing again. You did this once before. I don't want to use your calendar, just the task list so please bring back the option of a widget without the calendar option written at the top. Will use an alternative until I see AnyDo has been updated."
"Horrible marketing adds every time, removing the app."
"Best tasklist app I've ever used -- and trust me, I've been through a few. Ticktick literally has everything one could wish for when it comes to GTD -- habits, calendar, even Pomodoro timing(!) -- merged into one. single. app. My one complain is that while you can start Pomodoros for a task/habit/etc., you can't actually tag them afterwards. That would be rather useful, I think. It would allow me to see how much time I've spent doing different tasks that all fall within the same project."
Please add smart time to the app
"I strongly recomment that you will not use this app if you use outlook calendars! Fantastic App but only for those using Gmail. With outlook you will meet various problems.I realized this after purchasing full ap. Also Tasks posiible only by Google Tasks and attachments only Google Drive and Dropbox (One Drive not available)!!! Update: After installing Blue Mail app, syncing is working smoothly... Please give solution for outlook users and add outlook tasks. If bluemail could it then yo also do"
requires microsoft account. deal breaker.
"not bad, still new user tho"
I loved this app until the latest update. The latest update requires you to give it permission to read your messages otherwise leaving the app does nothing to the tree. What's the point in this app now? Just simply growing a tree whilst I go about my usual business on my phone. There is literally no point to this app anymore unless you pay or give it access to your messages/data. Really disappointed that the creators have completely undermined the whole point of this app. Shame shame shame.
"The app is really neat. It would be great if there was the option to pause 
timers!"
Best 'to do list' app hands down. Been using for 3 years. Android + mac integration is spot on. I genuinely love it. So so so useful
"Extremely aggressive in pushing the premium and paid version. Also overly complex since as its name denotes, it tries to do everything or anything. It may be beneficial to consolidate and duplicate tasks of several other apps even though some can perform better. Compare the shopping list in Google Keep which is easier to add or subtract items from a constant shopping list. This app combining tasks from other apps can be useful, depending on an individual's preferences and abilities."
It is very useful to remind things and keep them sheduled...
"I downloaded this app because it's one that syncs with our smart speaker. However, I have recurring tasks, some of which are daily and that option does not work at all. It works are far as setting them up goes. Once I mark a task as done it skips the next due date. So my daily tasks are only showing up every other day. Not happy with that at all. I am in the process of finding another app ASAP!"
After an update started showing really annoying full-screen ads. Been using it for quite some time. Will uninstall
Repeat reminder does not work at all and get spport button does not work. Plz do proper testing before publishing apps
"nice app but after enabling it, whenever i tried to open clock from taskbar this aap gets open instead, which i don't what"
I've tried a lot of to do apps... Like more to do apps than anyone should really try. This one is the best. It has everything I want EXCEPT the ability to change font.
"Great app, keeps me on track and efficient. Helps me stick to my New Year's goals. Just wish we could add more habits."
Good
Does not sync
include monthly to do list. which helps students to create timetable.
The latest update seems to have disabled notification sounds. I have tried every suggested solution and it still doesn't work making Forest and Sleeptown effectively useless for me. They were good when they worked.
"I used to love the app... Until I needed to synchronise to see my tasks to another device, then I found out syncing simply won't work and uninstalling/reinstalling didn't solve the issue."
"Spot on ! No frills, no compromises. This solves my QUEST for a to-do app, which has been going on for more than a year. This one is on point with being utilitarian and decluttered. I'm already recommending to everyone I know."
Excellent organizational capacities. Love the reminder if yesterdays tasks. The daily separation form the dump of all tasks which can be organized into other spots later
Useless. No nesting
"Looks good, imported fine from wunderlist, but will not sync with my desktop pc on windows 10. Huge disappointment and has affected productivity. Its in its early stages as an app so ill cut them a little slack, unfortunately my clients will not. Here is hoping it gets sorted."
Something weird is happening! I got a message saying that my tree has grown even if I didn't grow one ( after I click on give up button) or even started a new one afterwards!!?? Why this is happening??!!
Average app. No worth
Great app but crazy there's no Google Calendar integration!! Even tried setting this up with Zapier but it only creates an entry (with no link to any.do task title) for when the task is created and not when the task is scheduled. Will Google Calendar integration be coming to the app?
"This is a very good app, but it doesn't quite meet my needs. I canceled my account, but they kept charging me for months. I finally got through to their customer service, and they refunded all my money. I have adjusted my review to reflect this. Otherwise, this app is well thought out and worth trying."
"Seemed like a decent enough app, but I was looking for a calendar that worked with Google but that I could add local photos to events with, a feature currently lacking in Google calendar. Without that, didn't seem different enough to justify extra install."
"I like the app a lot, bit I can not make the notifications sound to work. I have enabled all notifications in setting - both the phone and the app but the only notification I'm getting is in the notification bar? Without the notification sound the app is quite useless."
It's user friendly... love using it..
Thank you for such a great app! Was wondering though if it were possible to sync also calendar reminders from Google calendar and not just events
App's widget still doesn't react correctly to dark mode changes. I can't see the list often!!
"Needs sketchy permissions to work properly! It used to not ask for these permission like allowing it to see my messages/personal info and control my apps. Like what?? Idk, it sketched me out. I used to love this app but it changed!"
"I really liked it on my old phone, but on my new phone it just doesn't work. The tree will not die if I leave my app, even though I did it in settings. Deepfocus mode won't activate even though I've allowed all permissions (storage and phone are the only ones that come up) And like you can extend your timer to 3hours could you make it extendable for longer?"
will not be using ever again.
Please add archiving for stagnant dailies
"good app,but Im a premium user for more than one year and have been requesting features on the official support forum (like change dates of lots of overdue dates at once on windows app) and never even got a response."
Good for working :3
Great app for organization and seeing where your time goes. I love that they brought back having days on separate screens to swipe across. I bought the pro version to support this company for making the best time management app I've come across! Thank you timetune. Keep up the great work. Edit: I don't like that in the new update the statistics don't show the percentages of how much time you spend in one tag. Can you bring that back??
I can organize everything through this one app. I love it. No complaints so far.
"Update: dropped 5 star rating to 1star. App will not sync. I have it on Android and iPad,and neither one of them will sync to the server. App store shows 8 months since any updates. Would not have paid for premium if I knew it wasn't going to be maintained. Original review: I wanted to make something like this myself, but they've already done a great job. I feel more obligated to the daily habits I'm trying to build, and it's great that it tracks my completion streaks."
"At first I liked it so I wanted to unlock the Pro features, but this can only be done via In-App purchases which means I'd have to pay over and over again for my family group members to have access to Pro. I hope the developers consider releasing a separate Pro version that can be purchased outright and shared with a Family Group."
"The app is good but a FAQ would be appreciated. For example, I cannot find out how to create a group for my tasks."
I like how easy is to create schedules for each day. Contains just the functions needed. Great app.
"Great until last update. Love the app, its a great tool, but since the last update, I frequently get server error notifications, and the app doesn't function in any capacity (can't chat in party, dailies and habits don't refresh, etc.). rebooting my phone and reinstalling the app did not solve the issue. I'd happily give this a 5-star if this could be fixed and I could get back to my daily log-ins and updates."
It's fine. The widget does not allow for refreshing and the auto refresh never happens quickly enough if at all. If there was a way to get to the app from the widget it would be whatever but you have to go find the app to go into it which is :/ the app definitely has it's uses I'm sure but I have to uninstall because we use the widget and if it's not functional it doesn't work for us
"I've been using it for a couple of years & it's worked well for me. I like being able to set reminders on tasks, something GTasks doesn't do by itself. I did spring for the paid version since i use it pretty heavily and to get the all-in-one widget. Worth it!"
Missing lot of features from Wunderlist
"A lot of work was put into this. I love the idea of it. I just got this, and I was looking through the app, seeing what I can do. I love the features and what you can do. You can use the app, without buying stuff but what your selling it for is crazy. $46 for one time purchase is a bit much for a task reminder. Or $10-$20 for half or full year. I love the app. I would pay for it if payment is $2.49 one time purchase. Or $12.99 for one time purchase, instead of a 6 months."
super cute and motivating but the server seems to constantly bug out on me
"Came back to see if I can use the app since I do like it, it's a great idea. I'm my case: I need to be able to add calendar events, reminders in one app 100% essential and afaik this isn't supported? I have a shared gcal, a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself. They also need to be managed in the app I use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me. Not just reminders, calendar events needs add, edit. Back to any.do"
works pretty good so far
writing this is not too good forest stay focused is good it what picture is good we can study while using our friends by opening are Bluetooth Wi-Fi and all of them but I am not happy from this forest stay focused we cannot give only one star otherwise I may give it a zero I am fad from this forest stay focused and am going to delete it's was trap am requesting please download this app it had lots off lots off lots off lots of AD so you don't like lots of AD no so don't download it please.
"Not for couples or friends. Subscription for ""teams"" to share tasks. Doesn't think money from their micro transactions shop is enough."
"Could be a great app except that like another user said, it does not sync between devices when the description claims that it can. That's a big letdown for me because when used any other of my devices, and when I switched phones, I couldn't sync the app up with my data or any habits I've been tracking, even though I have the premium account. When attempting to sync It always says that there is no internet connection, but there always is. So I can't give it a full 5/5 rating, otherwise I might."
"Great app. Could suggest rewards that fit the task type, offer actual customer / icon customization, and allow linkage of tasks to overarching goals that have separate rewards attached. Other than that - best app like this I can find - a lot of great features."
Sync is not good
I can't seem to create an anniversary or a birthday event like I used to. Please assist
I couldn't even make an account. It wont work
It should be possible to move subtasks between tasks and lists. Having to cut and paste is very inconvenient.
"I liked, but in my cellphone had some bugs (galaxy A8+). I think if this app had a function to sync with the phone calendar (google calendar or samsung calendar) it would be much better"
Offline support? At least make an offline list feature.
"Guys, what is a task limit? Why? It's not the way it should be."
"I tried out quite a few free scheduling apps that could be shared across members of a household/team, and this one was certainly best. One thing that I would like is if, when you make an event repeat, you could specify an end date for the repitition."
I really like it. The reason I'm giving a 4 star is that I wish the focus promo could be set for more than 120 mins. 120 mins means I've got to keep changing it againg and againg for longer focus periods which breaks the focus. P.s. I'm using the free version. I don't know whether it available on the premium version or not.
Never tried it yet
turned deep mode on and it's not working. I'll give it 5 stars when it works again
"The homescreen widget has 2-3 bad bugs on my Nokia 6.1. On the other hand, the app is very versatile - doesn't force me into any particular way of using it. It's so well done that I'm using it even for my non-""TODO"" notes. I've dropped specialized notetaking apps like Google Keep and Evernote because ""Tasks"" is better. The ""quick add"" feature is surprisingly useful. The author is responsive and polite."
"I don't know why, but it doesn't open...i click on it then i wait and at the end it notifies that the app has stopped."
"Need to be able to repeat tasks.  If it had that, I'd be my new calendar."
Wondeerful Wunderlist app closed down by the corporate US. Sad times.
Good
It is a lot better than the other apps out. An 8 or 16bit UI makeover would be dope. The pixel look and feel. Always nostalgic
"Its a to do list that can go everywhere with you and no writing! Can prioritize list as well great little app 11/2019 edit- hoping like other folks that they undo the changes. This app has gotten more difficult and counterintuitive with the last update. Used to be able to select multiple items to reschedule at one time. Can't do that anymore. Also used to be able to just type repeat everyday, repeat every Monday Wednesday and Friday etc. It now seems like only sometimes that works."
Going for free and better Microsoft To-do
"In this free version, we can add 5 habits only."
A very good app ... It helps me to manage my online classes and daily routine together... 😄😄😄😄
"Correct idea worng execution. The watch face UI cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands. The time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr, I wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there. Big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes I did give necessary permission. phone - one plus 7 OS build- Oxygen OS 9.5.5 GM57AA Further Action- Uninstalling Outlook- Would like to try it post improvement"
Excellent app... Good job!
Setting am/pm is not easy
"I understand that sometimes you need to replace product. But it beats me why they didnt keep wunderlist and just ditched idea of todo list? Maybe they dont want something that isnt tied to Microsoft? Anyway, app for now sucks, my shared lists from before dont work.. it was my main usage as it was so simple."
Had to reinstall this 3 times now. I already turned off the auto update feature. I keep losing my data.
Just a fancy Calender widget. Sure it looks fancy. But it doesn't add any functionality. It can't do much else. It can't track progress.
Bought the Paid version. The app fails to get data from anything except Gmail. Good concept but lacks in across provider connectivity.
It's hard to understand how it works
I love this app! It's so user friendly and helps me keep track of everything going on!
better to improve the app features
"I used to be a big fan of any.do products and I used any.do, any.cal for years, I think these apps are really easy to use. However, when I set a reminder for an appointment every Monday, it only allows me to set reminders on every Thursday( the date that I created that reminder) instead of Monday. it's really disappointing."
This app is just what I needed to keep simple to do lists.
"It's a really nifty app, with a lot more convenient features than wunderlist, and a lot more options for diff types of tasks. A very efficient way to stay organized and get things done."
Very good 👌 app this is I left many bad habits just because of this app
Pls add 24 hour view
"I love this app, but I do have one major gripe - I want an option to buy premium once (even at a higher price) and not as a monthly or yearly subscription. Edit - very unhappy with developer response to pricing. I want to buy premium for this great product they made, but it's NOT a service. This isn't Netflix. You're going to turn potential buyers away with this pricing model"
"1/ I'm very happy I paid for the app - I've used if for a couple years continuously now, and it has never let me down. 2/ This layout is excellent for taking my days schedule in at a glance. I highly reccomend trying it. 3/ The widget has pride of place on my homescreen, and my Android Wear watchface. The designer has done an incredible job of cramming all the important information into the widget, without confusing or overly cluttering the display. There are many useful customisations that I found easy to control."
Great app to organise your day
Uninstalled in 5 minutes. It didn't populate anything that I had on my calender. I even tried to manually put in events and it wouldn't show on widget
Loved it
Everything included in premium feature . Only frame work is there.
Perfect app for your daily routine planner
Good
"Honestly, it's by far the most useful app you could possibly find that offers so many things without a ridiculous price tag. Having access to all the major for free is incredible and ,unlike other apps, doesn't ram ""Upgrade to premium now"" messages. I personally find it useful for keeping on track with hobbies such as writing books, as on can easily track the things I need to do. I would highly recommend this app because it's easy to use and is not intrusive like other apps."
"Awesome app, better than any other planner. Work by time. Amazing! Thank U all!!!"
too many ads and require to pay for applications that are commonly found in play store.
"Started using this about a year ago and it quickly became a fixture on my home screen. It functions about as you would expect out of the box, which is nice because navigating the customization leaves a little to be desired."
"Still exploring, sry"
Terrible UI
"I've had this app for years- first the free app, now premium. I love being able to schedule tasks as well as events. I create different color-coded calendars for different categories of events, and it's really easy to sync calendars with my SO."
Infuriating keyboard gets in way cannot be closed
"Doesn't show character customisation, think it needs an update"
This app has a fantastic concept that being an MMO style game based around your success in real life. The game is entirely server based and I have a good internet connection but the app would constantly disconnect. I would like a single player mode of some sort no need for like a story or something just something to see your effects in game. So because of the insane amount of server issues I have experienced just using the app for a little but I could not recommend this which is a shame.
"Fundamental problem in their development cycle...force users to update, but the value to the consumer doesn't have a feedback mechanism prior to forcing the update. Is there not a beta program with participating users? Todoist, that's what you need to fix. For everyone else,my widgets have lost their usefulness and are now just place holders until I can remove the complete buttons, shrink text, have fully customizable widgets, or settle on another app. but really, focus on the root problem."
"Too many ads, and it doesn't automatically save your work. Also, everytime I exit, and reopen it, it brings me to a different page than I was on."
Same issue as Don Smith who wrote a review on 10/10/19. Will consider this app but the lack of slide visuals and character visuals makes the app in-op. Current phone is the Google pixel 4xl......perhaps I misspoke in regards to the reply. My issue is not with the visuals but the lack of visuals. Everything is blank for me so literally can not see half of the content.
please add a feature that make me add a friend to the habit such as habit competition app😥 i can't live without this feature
"Awful app. It doesn't stop me from accessing any app. Good concept, poor execution."
Awesome app.
"I used to love this app. It has great widgets and interface. However, about a month ago, it stopped syncing my work events and now they won't even appear. Turns out the account was removed. I re-entered the info and nothing came back."
App keeps crashing even after update . I use android. Please help this was the best app
I can't access the app. At the initial use I am able to use it but after like 2 minutes I am being kicked out of the app.
"Mostly really good, great for sharing tasks between people/phones/desktops, but the widgets on Android keep clearing themselves and have to be re-added to work again, and repeating tasks constantly change the day they alert you on, reminding me the day after or before I set them to. I keep having to edit them back again. Really frustrating. What's the point in a daily reminder if it keeps changing to try and alert you the day before it existed? Edit: and again, anytime there's a clock change!!!"
"It takes me about 2-3 seconds to switch between Events and Tasks tabs. Can you make it faster somehow? P.S. App is great, just what I need - schedule and to-do list in one!"
"I wish one could back up his habits, otherwise it a good & straight forward app"
"Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium."
I don't remember the details of my pro membership to restore purchase all instructions are in Chinese this is so bad.
it's a great app but I'm not sure about the security and privacy of it. I like apps that mention in the description itself stating that they don't collect data from users. a little info on that would be nice to see in the description thanks
"Big Bug, How can u miss this. When we search by name, it just searches the notes within the lists created. It does search group names, it doesn't search the list title. It searches only the notes (that are within the list) how stupid is that."
"Why did you show the checkboxes in widget when you can't even check/uncheck it via the widget? Its just so frustrating to go to the app just to check a list. Other than that, this app is good."
"I live this calendar app, but I wish it was a widget."
"Perfect but I also use the chrome add-on and it duplicates the simultaneous focus periods and the stats show 2x of my actual focus time. Can you add also a pause period that will not let you to leave the app but run to an emergent issue just in case, then turn back without killing your tree?"
"Very good app to help keep and develope new habits! Best gamification of tasks, habits and to do lists!"
"So far it's not flexible enough for me. Also, there needs to be an option to remove 'general discussion ' from the dash board. There seems to be a startling number of people with goals surrounding masturbation and porn and I just don't need to see that when I'm trying to inspire myself to play more music. I'm going with the stars as a benefit of the doubt as I haven't given it much time but I can't see me using this."
"The app keeps my annoying life very well organized even when I'm stressed because it can be used as any other kinds of lists such as a revenge list or a list which represents the ones that you've loved or hated as well....... I really owe a lot to this kind of app to get better when updating....... And I hope that we don't need to pay continuously, but buy once, free forever......😂😄"
Works fine for importing calendar. Can't say same for tasks. OS: Linux
i hate it😠
I want dark mode without payin. Like the light mode is too light
Finally something good 👍
Complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest. Atleast widget should be available for trials.
"What if one wants to add a habit wherein one wants to do that thing 4 times in a week and not on 4 specific days of the week. I guess while adding a habit, this app requires one to select 4 specific days. Just a suggestion. It would be really great if this flexibility can be allowed."
"Nice planner but you shouldn't have to pay to have ""week""view. I may not purchase now."
Handy.
Best for schedule
Just upgraded to premium version. App and Google play list subscription at $27.99. I got charged $29.84. ???
"Generally pretty good, but a lot of awkward design choices: no compact mode, inefficient use of colors for organization, difficulty selecting and moving tasks, lack of icon consistency, preset snooze and reminder time options rather than being able to choose them yourself."
Not bad
Very easy to make new routines and activities if you want to organize your time a little better
Reminder notification not on time for about an hour so it is inconvenient
not user friendly.
Good. But repeat mode is not working properly. I am looking for some other app
Why google sync is not available?
"It would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect... if I say I want a task to be weekly, but make it so I can complete that task any day, what I'm trying to do, is make the task flexible, so I can do the weekly task whatever day of the week I feel like, instead however, making it available everyday turns it into a daily task, which I will be punished for by not completing daily, my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to-do list which is really frustrating."
"Great app, very user friendly. Definitely recommend it!"
"I love the overall concept, and, the diverse options for setup. Though, so many setting options are a little overwhelming to sort out. I've had the app for a few weeks and I am still trying tweak my layout ... visuals are everything for me. I believe, when originally setting up a few weeks ago, I was a bit annoyed to have spent time choosing colors for the widget to find out it is a premium feature (To Developer: plz be upfront on the premium feature options). I think once I get it really working for me it will be a fave app."
Cant view a month in one screen. One week is the maximum that it will show. Uninstalled.
Can't sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me. I'm not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar. Pointless.
A lot of functionality but not so simple to use
The app is perfect for people trying to get more organized it's easy to use and I use it all the time for homework or workouts the only tiny problem is that it has some locked features that u have to pay for
Excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones
It's good. But you can only have 5 habits to track. If you want more... $$$ in displease because it's like a demo... :( but nobody tells you.
"Pretty good app but nothing crazy that I can't achieve with Google calendars already if there is I'm not in need for the feature atm. I've really been looking for the feature to set a reoccurring remind with a full custom option for say repeat every 43 days or repeat 3 months, then 4 months then 3 then 4 etc this sorts of features would be amazingly handy as you would then not have to set up a new reminder for each date after having worked them out manually. If you add this feature please LMK"
The best To-Do App ever🤩.. Just please add custom themes options to add more backgrounds or unsplash integration so I can choose more backgrounds..
"So far I love the app. It allows you to have multiple lists. I like the different colour options for each list. The sub task section is useful, especially since you can see it under the main task."
"Just changed phone. Didn't keep anything from my Premium account. Can't even create a new account without erasing current data... -2* for that inconvenience /// Has helped me tremendously develop new habits. UI is perfect! The app and widgets allow quick and easy habit tracking. Counting habits are useful, but it would be great to be able to see near misses in order to track improvement better. Customization of the interval chosen to calculate percentages would be very helpful."
"I don't quite get the categories for tasks, I hope there is an option to 
hide it or remove it."
I soooo love this app. I am not a gamer but gamifying my habits makes it more interactive. You wouldn't want your avatar to die so you'll do your tasks.
It's good but i think it would be better if the routines could be sorted
"I have been using this app for years, and have loved it, but the latest version is sucking my battery. It's very frustrating."
Love this app.. But I wish i can add due date for my task.
"While it certainly wasn't expensive, it was a waste of money in the fact 
that I found this app to do very little more than any calendar. After 
reading the FAQ, it says it's more than a calendar... How? Especially since 
adding anything is done in the same way you create a calendar event. The 
""routine"" function is a missed opportunity in that I think it will help me 
establish a morning routine for myself but in reality it's about creating 
calendar events that repeat, a slightly expanded component of any free 
calendar our there. When I think of ""tuning my time spent"" I'm thinking, 
better organization for smaller tasks. Then find myself spending an hour 
setting 1 minute events for myself that I was never actually notified about 
lol what irony. Unfortunately it was not time, or money, well spent."
Can not share from the application to my email please assist
"I like this app, but in the world of Time/Schedule Management you have to be multi-platform. I would recommend that your next step in development is a web interface as the majority of a professionals day is spent on a PC or laptop."
"Not much better than Wunderlist but now it's attached to my Microsoft account for work so I cannot share my personal lists, like the grocery list, with my family."
Very good. Probably 5 stars when I learn all its tricks
Not as advertised
Lot of difficult methods to organize.🙅‍♂️
Has potential but i need it for the programer which costs money
I wish I could create notes without having to select a date. Otherwise so far so nice 🤓
NOT into your ads. I've had your app on my phone for YEARS. Uoure about to be deleted for a Google calendar. Sorry.
Easy to use and the alarm works great
I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.
The prices for this app is abit stupid when I can find apps that do the same thing for free! 26$ should give me life not everyone is rich !!!
"Pop up notification (alarm with voice) is not available. Please do needful. Check to do reminder, it will help you to make your app improve."
"well, It is good and motivational, but I don't get notifications for the reminder. Moreover, you have to pay for the widget"
This app is awesome!
"I like this app as it is a simple way of tracking your habits. However, there are a couple of things I wish were improved. 1. If I have updated all of my habits for the day, the app should know that and stop the daily reminder to complete them. 2. I wish the analysis was a little better. Have some graphs visually showing progress. Also, how about showing how I am doing on my habits as a whole, not just the individuals? For example, if I have a day where I don't do any of my habits. Thx"
Great app. I use it daily 👌 suprr
"I bought the full version. its a fun app to challenge yourself. I would like to see an update gives you the choice to choose a pen or pencil icon or a book icon, which seem to be missing, that would be useful. for example, if you want to write a book, it would be nice to have a ""book""📚📗📘📙📓📔icon, or ""pen""🖋🖊 icon, or ""pencil"" icon... UPDATE: I seem them now! Thanks for responding and letting me know. Looks like I needed to scroll farther down to see them. 👍"
"Can you make the graph fully editable eg without importing from calendars? 
I want to be able to add stuff without it having to access my calendar"
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day."
"Added feature synchronizer Connect, added the note writing feature during the call, added a feature synchronized with the mail"
"I don't want make an account before trying out the app! Give us a week trial before making us sign up, please."
It doesnt update between your calanders. I need a planner that stays up to date with my calendar changes. This is not it.  Waste of money.
"Love this app and everything it offers (keeping track of tasks, calendar, pomodoro, habit tracking, statistics) - so versatile and intuitive, looks amazing and straight up the only thing keeping my life together right now! I pretty much bought premium immediately and intend to keep doing so. Thank you so so so much for this app!! :)"
"yeah, this is not user-friendly. there should be some kind of tutorial, this is not the kind of app you can just jump in and start using, which is what I was hoping for."
Would gladly pay for this if it was Outlook compatible.
Excellent
"I can't take take the pro version and is showing that card number is wrong inspire of being it correct. I tried it a no. Of times but couldn't figure out. Plz help. Otherwise, it is the the best productive app tht I have seen"
"For $4.99 to $9.99, I'd like more widgets and customization. As it stands, the main widget, ""List"", is block white."
"Awesome app but hate the new placement of the buttons. When you use to create a task you clicked under the title to select when you wanted a reminder. Now it's halfway down the page. I keep hitting ""share task"" and it takes forever to back out of that screen."
UI atrocious! Nothing fits.
"Agree with other reviewers - Wunderlist worked much better. Have issues with items not synching between devices, takes a long time to manually synch, uploading attachments to items doesn't seem to work without restarting the app, the Windows pc version is particularly poor. Appears Microsoft have mucked around with the code base and broken a really good app :("
Switching from one list to another stinks. Otherwise helpful
"I have enjoyed navigating my way around the set up so far, definitely worth a subscription for the full experience. Shared it with friends but unfortunately it's only available on Android. One major issue though is I can't select the quantity to use for consumables. If you decided to put in 1,000 credits in there, you'll have to click 3,000 times to use it. Takes the fun out of it. Also, wish it had a web page version like Habitica so everyone can share the experience regardless of their OS."
Love it. The answer of my hope. Thank you HabitNow 🤍
"Great in a lot of ways, but a huge drawback is that you can't edit the start date or previous inactivated/activated dates for a habit. So, if you've been doing a habit for a few weeks before you add it to the program, you can't record those two weeks of success in the program. Or, if you intentionally stopped a habit for a time period, but didn't inactivate it during your chosen time off, your percentage is dragged down."
I don't really liked it much . Waste of intenet.
Expensive
i got no notification
"App was good in past but not anymore, it has stopped sync and many bugs creeped in due to no maintenance and update since. As per details in app Page, last update was on 28th Jun 2018, but still it is the first thing that comes in results when I search for ""Habit"" 😲 I guess Google should stop advertising an app that is not managed since years."
เป็นapp ที่ทำให้มีสมาธิในการอ่านหนังสือมากขึ้นแต่แอพเด้งบ่อย อยากให้ปรับปรุงและพัฒนาต่อนะคะ
Just awesome!
"Hmm, I just don't like it"
"I really like the application so far. Great interface and feature set. I'd really like to see and would even do an inapp purchase for would be a much larger icon set. I think being able to group characteristics and skills would be awesome too. Even better if the group can collapse. It would also be cool to see a health bar that represents the amount of time you have in a day to be productive. Have it decrement as time passes and maybe make it adjustable for how much time you have in a day i think another tasklist app does that. Overall a great application, I hope you continue working on this application.  Edit: The app is still decent, but taking away the option to just remove ads for a one time price in favor of subscription only has made me decide to stop using this application and change my previous 5 star rating to a 2 star rating."
Way to confusing to use the tutorial didnt help at all
Garbage. Fails to notify reminders about half the time unless app tab is open. Phone and app settings verified. Missed a long awaited appointment this morning...why even bother setting reminders
"have depended on this cal app for years. love the display options. monthly view is my go to and can be crammed with text. love the time input clock, multiple reminders. still features I've not explored."
"At first oke, unless you don't want to give permission to Google.... Each time you Deny to share you're data, the question simply pops up 10 more times, hoping you click allow. This is pesky!!!"
Another shity microlimp product. They can't even copy a decent app.
Hey i was very glad to use calendar 30 until now. I can not edit anything ... If i want to delete something is reappear every time. I can't move or delete. If is not working i want my money back. I will change the review if you solve this problem. Edit :I will edit the review after you ll solve this problem. I send it an email also.
Terrible app
It's really confusing! Its hadd to make routines and stuff. Just over all really confusing. But over great way to track routines. I love the tag idea. Mabey you should add a default school tag?
Everything is perfect. Its just that the completed tasks are too faded to be visible in the widget. Kindly fix this. I am deducting 2 stars for this problem
"Now you can't even see the *today's* completed tasks without paying premium? Seems like ""how much inconvenience can we cause to the users to force them to pay before they abandon the app?"" This is a todo list. It's not like you've solved a new problem, produce content, or provide any significant service. Response/edit: currently, you can only see by project or subtasks, but not by today's tasks. Seeing today's completed tasks is the bare minimum to observe your progress throughout the day."
Simply amazing....just try it.
"This at is very easy to use, and it's a simple design. You can make a bunch of list's, and this app keeps them all organized. Put yours goal list, shopping list, to do list, and any other list you want to make in one organized place. I'm happy with this app. There is a lot of features in this app, and it's well put together. It's worth your time to check it out."
Good Interface but recent tech issues. App slow to open.
I loved TT and paid for Premium but sooner or later their reminder will let you down :( You can't count on it unfortunately. And it's not because of Android but due to a flaw in the app. If a reminder pops up and you accidentally tap somewhere else in the screen or if you're busy now then the reminder disappears and never reminds you again until you manually find this task again in the list and set a new date for the reminder.
"Frequently the widget stops to show my to-dos, requiring reboot to show again"
I would not give a star also bcoz the thing is it should have more function....Next time when i download the app ....it should be a good app..... TROUBLE SHOOTING..^_^^_^^_^^_^(^^):-[:-[:-[
I'm having lots of fun. I feel motivated to do more in the day. So far I have had no adds and the free version has everything you could need. I just hope it will work for me long term!
No
Easy to use app. Allows me to keep track of my busy schedule.
It's good. But you can only have 5 habits to track. If you want more... $$$ in displease because it's like a demo... :( but nobody tells you.
"It's actually sleek, beautiful, well-designed and exactly what I would want, but without syncing it becomes much less helpful. As soon as that feature is added I will reinstall this as my primary note app."
Decent app but repeatedly asking me to pay a monthly subscription for a fancy to-do list is completely unacceptable. Take no for an answer.
"It's really fun and rewarding to see my trees being planted and grown in the forest whenever I finish the focus timer. This app has helped me get through some of the more dreaded block study periods in my school life, and continues to help me stay focused whenever I should and need to be."
Missing back buttons on some screens. Otherwise great.
I think it's good so far and it helps me focus on my work
"I love this app. It has so many features and I love the creator listens to the app's reviews. That's rare, and when it happens, I have to give props to the creator. If there is a feature I would like, it's items that can change your current photo (temporarily). This app is a 10 🌟 app and I highly recommend it"
"This is my first time using a scbedule app and I love it so far! However, I'm a little bit confused on how it's supposed to work: I'm able to set up routines for everyday instead for single days in a week? I'm asking this, because when I made my routines for Monady, everything went smoothly, but when the next day comes, my routines aren't showing up at my schedule anymore. Do i have to set up the routines for EACH DAY, for my routines to be at the schedule, or is there a better option?"
"I have been using this app for a while, really trying to get to grips with it but I've come to conclude that it's not me. If you feel like you need less complexity in your life them this probably isn't for you as this adds a new system that you have to get to grips with and plus the gamification aspect can be quite destracting and finnecky. I think if this were to ever be useful for me it would need a separate environment for tasks, habits and dailies."
"It's really cute and motivating. But what I'm missing, would be an option to set a tree to be planted at a specific time."
Ótimo para agendar tudo o que tem que fazer no dia! Muito bom para quem gosta de se organizar em tudo!
"Fantastic app, does everything it needs to. No more bits of paper all round the house with a half finished list of jobs."
The layout for the app is awesome. But it would be better if non-routine task can be added into the timeline with the same activity for routine task.
"Great Very usefull, please add fitur search to find an old note"
"Need the calendar view, but I'm not paying ongoing fees for it though."
Tick Tick is good but it should add more ring tones please try
"## You ""reaching out"" has not, in any way, addressed the question I asked, I'll uninstall. Thanks anyway. ## * Rather disingenuous response. When doing a local backup it informs the user that Manual backup ""will be removed in a future version"". Why would I continue using it if I will not be able to to do a local back up my data at some point ""in the future"" ? * I don't use the ""cloud"" so this will be useless to me if I can't backup locally."
"Habitnow is the first todo list with a key feature I've been looking for: to-do items that are automatically created at certain times. As such it is the best such app I've ever used. The only problem is that the author made no provision for hiding completed items. They just hang around cluttering the list--the best it does is move them to the bottom. I find it very odd that anyone would want to stare at completed to-do items. Certainly that shouldn't be the default, but there it is."
It's good but complicated a bit
Still trying figure it out
Very good reminder
Amazing
Acceptable
"Simple to use, easy to make categories, tasks, sub tasks, reminders etc"
The idea is just wow. Well executed.
Its a good app but i think thers some glitch i cant have more than 6 tasks when i create one it just dosen't show.
"Update: Thanks for the fast response! I have a suggestion: I find it very tempting to turn deep focus off all the time. As I am not very intrested in the leaderboard, it would be really helpful if turning deep focus off would affect my coins instead. Tnx! :)"
The ads on this app are cancerous and the subscription model for this type of app is ludicrous. Charge a single flat rate.  If the style does change to flat rate/ad free I'll gladly change my review.
Can't buy pro version on note 9? Apparently in app billing is not available on my device? Guess I can't give you my money...
Just add Google Calendar integration
I am on premium and i don't receive whatsapp messages as reminders
How do I set a daily / weekly repeating task?
"I had too many projects, ""to do"" items and lists, I sometimes couldn't sleep. I'm not a big ""techy"" but this app is totally amazing and it has changed my life and more free time on my hands ! I'm still getting use to the change 😄 The only thing I would like to see on some of the lists, is a way to prioritize in order of execution...but still life-changing app..Thanks!👌👍👏🙏"
It enurages me to hat want to do in order to develop good healthy habits.
Used to work great. Unfortunetly notifications no longer go off for ir making it useless. Have checked they are not blocked
Can I use it offline?
I don't miss Wunderlist. This app is great. The only thing it doesn't have is integration with Google Assistant. That would be great. Otherwise this is super.
I would like to see it in the lock screen.
Love it. I'm self employed with several appointments a day. Being able to see my appointments at a quick glance is really helpful and a must for me.
This app was really good So Far this is the best app I used to stay on track BUT I hate it when I need to pay for premium. Please make it free?
app is great but the events are not getting created . Only one two events for a day is created than even it shows created its not
I just downloaded this yesterday and I am enjoying this app so far. Especially the sound after you finished a specific task. I am happy that I found this app. I will use this for work and everyday goals. Thanks! 😊
Not bad at all
Great app when it works but don't assume you will get any support when it doesn't. Always read our help files and that is it.
Worked for 2 days. Now I can't enter anything. I enter date time description hit save it says saved but nothing shows up on the lo k dial thingy. too bad nice. oncept. tho

"Great concept, but can they hire an artist, this artwork is outdated!! otherwise I would use this"
"1. Struggling to find where to change the alarm tone? Both system and app config been modified yet the same strange tone remained. 2. Anywhere to change preferred language? （Thanks Steve, that's exactly what I did, changed every tone/sound related item in the app setting, as I said, it did not work, probably it works for others, or it's the Oppo reno mobile issue)"
"A core function missing is the ability to disable a routine/ daily 
occurrence for a specific day. For example, I usually exercise from 6pm to 
8pm every day, so I created an event that happens every Monday to Friday. 
Today is a Thursday and due to an unexpected occurrence, I can't exercise 
today. I wanted to change that my 6-8pm block of time just today, but can 
only do so by deleting the event for EVERY Monday to Thursday to clear my 
timeline. Makes no sense to clear that block of time and need to re-create 
that exercise block for all the other Monday to Fridays. If something 
unexpected happens at 6pm next Friday, I'll have to delete it ALLL, and 
recreate all over again after just to clear my timeline. If you get this 
core feature right, then the app would be complete."
"While I am satisfied with the utility of this app, I am particularly disappointed with the widget function. The tasks that I mark as completed must be removed in the widget immediately or the next day, as is done in Evernote. Instead, the striked-out tasks keep displaying in the widget, which is simply frustrating. Further, there should be a Calender (month) view too, so that one can refer to previous tasks and know the date on which one completed the task."
The widget is amazing! I use it all the time. Excellent product. It just works.
Not looking for an app where I need to pay
So good. I won't worry at all. And I can catch up at things without missing anything. I got my routine right either. And I cannot forget and miss things too often. Good. It's so good....
"simple to use, easy UI, i no longer carry lists on paper! thank you Dev for a lovely app! 👍👍😀 I just downloaded it again onto my new phone, your app is just so stable and convenient. I like the prompts on new installation, slick. I will contribute some $$ asap 👍💖"
"Every now and then appears to disconnect from certain calendars. Support didn't have an answer. Otherwise, I love it."
"Okay so far as I have used, the app was pretty good. I read that this is s new one, and I like all the features present in it. However there is still lot of room for improvement. I have a small suggestion to make, you could add a new feature that marks things to be done or followed and if not done it sets an overdue and in the end of the day it tells what are done and what are not. That way people will have something that looks out for them as they follow the Timetable :)"
Really helped to keep my life organized.
So help me.
"Great format and tracking. £7 seems excessive for upgrade feature to use as a widget... Also, people have a form of spirituality rather than a religion: can that not be reflected in the app too, for inclusivity? Removing forum comments would be a great option: an unnecessary distraction."
Great App!!
There should be add different time schedule in app not be in mobile colander
Why was I charged $1.49 for this app? I was charged 2/4/2020.
It's really nice. I want to upgrade to premium. My language is set to English but options during upgrading are set in Chinese. I don't understand it. So i can't continue with the upgrade. Can you assist me how? Thank you...
Motivational and funny remiders really help in pushing to do the task
"Great app, let's you customize pretty much anything you want to create your own system. Only reward app I kept coming back to. Has helped me to create change in my life."

"The Apss so far is the best to do Apps I have use, however the Tag unable to sort alphabetically, we hav to everytime sort manually, not user friendly. I will rate 5 star if can settle this problem"
Why this app is not installing in my phone
"It's fairly easy to use, however the alarm  doesn't  work"
Awesome app to track your life.
"Not sure why but it doesnt seem to alert you or at least does intermittently after its first alert. For example I had a habit to check a website every day at 11:00 to check for updates, it worked the first time however I get no other updates thereafter. Not much ise if theres no consistency."
This is perfect. I'm able to get all of my family calendars in one place without having to lug around a traditional agenda. Also they are wonderful at fixing any issues and responding to all emails.
"Manchmal gestaltet es sich leider schwierig, gemeinsam einen Bäume zu pflanzen."
Very basic calender. Outdated UI . Not possible to integrate with Google task or other task managers. Few functions for collaborative work . MOST DESIRED FEATURE of a calender is a ability to add events and add invites from other apps and emails and thats missing.
Confusing and what they don't tell you before you download is that you have to pay for mostly all the features
The pop-up advertisements make the free version impossible to use. I will be forced to change to a different app after years of use
"Has the potential to be an excellent all in one calendar and to-do list, however I cancelled my subscription two weeks in as: 1. Subtasks automatically repeat when repeating main task is completed, regardless of time and due date settings. This should be optional. 2. Subtask reminders should be optional 3. Calendar functions are very limited, e.g. ability to set up an event rather than a task would be a valuable addition"
"Would be awesome except when I put start in weekly view in the settings, I can no longer access monthly view or change the settings ..."
Earlier this app was working fine but now frequently missing to remind task on set time.
Too complicated UI design. I just need a mindless tracker
"The premium version might be good but the free version is more restricted then other to-do apps, you can not even use the labels/ tags function without paying. If you are looking for a free todo list this is probably not the app for you."
"Worst customer care, they can't manage a refund, I'm very disappointed. SCAM"
"I have been using this premium version of app from past 6 months and its really great, but i still believe there are few feature still missing in it to make things easy. Like there should be dashboard which gives details of all habbits progress in bar percentage marked successful. Currently you have to go to each habbit and check the status. So a centralized section giving more details on the progress would be helpful like it is in Habbit tracker app. Also a dynamic habbit counter could be added"
Awesome app The best i've ever used
love it. Cant wait for it to do even more.
Great concept! Has me waking up on schedule and doing my tasks so I dont loose life and earn exp! Just one thing. I cant do quests. I got the dust bunnies quest but I have no clue what to do with it. Help?
Good
I love this app and use it on my Android phone. Now I have an iPad and cannot find this app for it. Is there an iOS version available?
"I like the concept because I've been trying to gamify my free time for a while, assigning a predifined score to each habit practiced the most during every hour, and all I wanted was the positive and the negative habits to affect the same progress bar, with the possibility to keep track of a daily score, with a possibly negative value. It's a damn shame but this aint for me. I wish it was more customisable"

"nice app but the free version is really limited. should allow at least 1-2 apps for whitelist, and more in premium. I just want to be able to jot notes/thoughts, that's it."
"I'm really glad someone is making an app like this, but it feels like a very early version and it makes more sense to have a kickstarter instead of subscription if you need the cash for primary development. Loads more customization is needed, including a) allowing uploads for your own artwork for cover/theme b) ability to add/delete the modules you need (delete at least - I don't track water so it's a waste for me) and c) landscape mode. I plan to follow development though and good luck!"
I just started using it. So I'm not sure how good it is yet. I do really wish you could do bullet points like: * - - That you could check off. It would be much easier in some cases than a separate sub list. & That is currently what I need 😪.
"My favourite productivity and habit tracker app, even though I don't use too many features it can provide. It's attractive, and it feels like more fun, but I like to keep it simple. Together with my (paper) Productivity Planner I am unstoppable!"
Nice app very useful
MS has screwed up wunderlist the same as to skype.... So clunky and average poorly thought out; should have just changed wunderlists logo and colour scheme. The desktop version is slow (10s) to respond. You can be doing changes on the desktop and it get jammed up with app.
Highly recommended. I have never had a problem. Easy to use. No ads. I love it.
This is perfect. Recently switched to pro version. Totally worth it :) Please add an alarm system when the tree is successfully planted. This will help people who follow pomodoro techniques like me.
"Bills ,"
"Not bad but not great. Pros: 3rd party calendar sync, time line view, icons & colour options to customise. Cons: can't sync devices, no task list or tick box. More options needed such as daily time line view, font size & highlight current day. Editing isn't easy & I think the whole app including widget could have a neater, tidier look. Overall it's not very intuitive, needs more options & flexibity. It has some way to go. I've got premium btw."
"NEW: Great concept but NOT for confidential data because it's not encrypted (nor PW protected on phone or PC) and, one day, Any.Do company will get hacked & ALL your stuff be be out there, like EquiFax. RESOLVED: App loses your work. eg: I created a new task, started a ""notes"" section, pasted it in some material and clicked save. Then I went to another app to get more material but when I returned to any.do, my notes were GONE!. Your ""save"" button is fraudulent if it does not save when clicked!"
Many features are locked and require a subscription. Did not want to pay without trying. And even given the limitation the trial period is limited to 1 week. This is too harsh. Uninstalling.
I don't know how useful this will be yet. But I should point out that subscribing to your Instagram shouldn't be an infinitely repeatable task xD
Without premium features it's just garbage. What have kept you guys from removing the free version from Play store?
This app is really beneficial specialy for studying. Please add more music with higher quality. Or s.th new to buy.
"I set a reminder since last week. It didn't even ring at the chime of the clock while I observed. It rang post 10min approx, that too when I accessed the app to see what's the fault. Please look into this bug."
Hi. How do I add back my premium account. I deleted account by mistake.
Swipe to delete is terrible. Takes almost 5 swipes so work rendering the app useless.
"'It's free, forever' but 'reminders are a premium feature.' Hmm. I'm dyspraxic, without much money to waste, and I'm looking for a to-do list app to help with this. Without reminders, this app is functionally useless to me. Disappointed that you've opted to content-carve to this extent, and I'd argue your claim of being free is misleading. Please reconsider which features to gatekeep, because locking basic functions behind a paywall makes me *less* likely to support you financially."
"This app is exactly what I was looking for! You can have tasks repeat daily, weekly, monthly, every three days, every Tuesday and Thursday, etc. You can also add one-time tasks that will show up every day on your checklist until you complete it. This has made my daily life so much easier and keeps me from forgetting to do important things. My one suggestion to make the app better would be the ability to drag and drop tasks and habits into a specific order. Besides that, it is GREAT 👍"
I have a Wonderful experience with this App my only concern is sometimes the alarm rings at other times it does not
Closing and crashing when adding tasks and project. Support answering but doesn't help.
The android homescreen widget keeps on hanging every now and then. I'd have to remove the widget and then add it again to the home screen to make it work. It's really a headache. I may opt out of the app if the widget continues to behave like this. Google calendar was what I was using before and that worked completely fine.
Just what I needed!
EDIT: Even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great! Thank you for taking my review into consideration! Please please please! Bring back the old horizontal interface. Or at least have an option for it. I used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday. But now I find it quite useless.. I understand how it could work for some people but it's definitely not working for everyone (as I've seen in other reviews).
"I've been using Habitica for a few years now and while I love the idea, from a technical standpoint the mobile app is broken. It feels like something you would have on your phone back when touchscreens were a new thing. The most annoying bugs are: party screen not updating after you accept a quest invitation so you're not sure if you accepted it, spamming buffs sometimes reduces your mana without actually applying the buff and party chat not updating (have to restart the app to see new messages)"
What a wrost feature. It shows my email in conversation section! Fully wrost.
This has become the second time since I reinstalled the app All the previous data had been erased and it keeps on crashing for some unknown reason
Not very intuitive
Love love love this app... but you guys can add some more features to make it a bit more easier to use..
"4 years later, still my go to calendar app."
Hard to control make this app easy to control. It's eating my head.
"I loved the app, its unreal!! The only reason i give it four stars is because i would add a section with to do list opcions for the tasks that doesn't have an specific time!!! Do that and i'll give you five stars"
Great app but crazy there's no Google Calendar integration!! Even tried setting this up with Zapier but it only creates an entry (with no link to any.do task title) for when the task is created and not when the task is scheduled. Will Google Calendar integration be coming to the app?
After the new update i cannot plant the new tree (real tree)
"This app is beautiful, and has really helped me keep my business, large family, homeschool and church activities all in order! No more chaos for this girl!"
"I wanted to like it, iinitially it looked great but it has such a limited window of time view it's no good for planning. A few hours view and that's it. Scrolling hour by hour day by day? Useless. Its sole function appears to be to tell you what you've got coming up in the next few hours which frankly is not much use to anyone as far as I can see. Cloud Cal uses similar circles with a view of the whole month which would be great but sadly the pro version doesn't work so no go there either."
"Paid for the premium app last year, now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when I first paid for it. Lots of complaints on here. Get one of the open source habit trackers & back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly & try to charge again. Seen this happen so many times."
"PRO: The functionality and UI are one of the best of these kinds of apps. Everything has a simple look to it, but you can always go deep, add a reminder here, a folder there and do exactly what you want it to do. CON: The feature I want the most (more than 5 repeatable tasks, ""habits"") is locked behind a subscription paywall, and there is no reason for a subscription model. I'd gladly drop a reasonable one time payment for it, but not the asking price month after month, I'm not rich and nether is my country. All in all great if you can afford it, frustratingly limited if you can't."
"Great concept the idea of this is great but theres a couple things that need work and i have a few ideas app is very slow or laggy. Sometimes it wont let me click on the sugested address. Also would be useful to be able to click address in planner and pull up directions in google map, i would also like to be able to link a list to a event and or address would also like to be able to ""build my desired layout ,more themes and stickers"
"App is great. Helps me keep track of my daily habits. I like how the interface is simple and easy to use. However, I've been experiencing issues tracking my habits using the widget."
"Todoist has been a big help for me getting organized and I love using it. Unfortunately I can only give it three starts due to a problem I've been having for months now. Long story short, my weekly streak doesn't reset when I fail to meet my weekly goal. I've contacted their customer support team twice since the problem started and both times I was told they were checking with the dev team followed by silence. No explanation or solution."
"Only complaint is how often it asks you to rate it. Other than that, the app is even so great IMO that it's work buying the subscription. I love how customizable it is. For sure one of my top 5 favorite apps."
"app crashed after creating a daily task with 2 day habit. would fail and bring up a warning that the task failed and to press OK. however you couldnt tap ok, it just did nothing. this happened every time. gave up and uninstalled the app. on a pixel 2 XL"
VERY GOOD APP BUT IN WIDGET THERE IS A NO OPTION IN LIST WISE SELECT TODAY TOMORROW OR ALL PLEASE UPDATE FOR THIS OPTION THEN IT WILL BE FAR BETTER PLEASE UPDATE EXAMPLE IF THERE'S A CALL LIST IN WIDGET IT SHOWS IN CALL WIDGET LIST ALL CALL TODAY TOMORROW OTHER ALL DAY BUT IT SHOULD OPTION TO SELECT TODAY TOMORROW ETC.
how to use bakwas i am vrry an gry
You need to pay its not really free
"Highly recommended , it's really working well"
Not bad
My events show up at the wrong time in my calendar even when they've been manually entered. What's the point of a planner that doest let you plan.
"Used it twice, so far so good"
"**UPDATE**. I uninstalled this app. It now causes my phone to crash when I reboot-which is everyday. *******I downloaded this app because the other app I was using wouldn't always notify me. Also, they recently decided to change from an analog clock face to having to scroll (similar to a digital clock) to set the due time. I tested this app before I started copying all my tasks, but I came across a problem. When creating a repeat, there is no way to set it to do a certain day of the month (ie: the 3rd Saturday of the month, or the Last Sunday of the month). This is a big issue for me because I have certain things I want to do, but it's not always on the same date of the month. Hopefully, this can be added/changed soon."
"Better than Google Tasks, Microsoft To Do, etc. Stephen has outperformed the biggest tech companies in the world with this side-project that has everything I need in a to-do app and feels just right. The widget is great. List creation, item sorting, sub-tasks, reminders, repeating due dates, task notes, priorities, and quick-add are all here and a breeze. Lots of ways to customize in Settings. Once the web version is done so I can sync/manage on my desktop, I'll go Premium. Thanks Stephen!"
Helps a lot in reminding of tasks to be done on daily basis.
"Hello Team, I am not able to set different colours for different sectors. Could you please help me show how its done?? I purchased your app in light that It will give me option for above."
It crossed my mind to buy the full version but then i saw they want a monthly payment. Why not just make it $5 lifetime? Seems like a good app not sure who copied who with liferpg seems too similar.
"alot of bugs, such as the friend list is inaccurate and also when you leave the app long enough it will sleep and n function, please fix asap"
Love the app and the widgets are great!
"1. Apart from events, how to import Reminders from Google Calendar App? 2. How to import the tasks from Google Tasks App?"
App is good to use but it's premium so Not using now.
The app is real good and helps in improving the productivity! An improvement that could be made is to hasten the sync up with the calendar. It is taking quite a long time to reflect in the sectrograph after adding any new event!
Very useful in my day to day activity. Able to share different calander events with others and view theirs as well.
Give a visual of whole day... Thanks Google team 👍
"I want my (overall) forest as the home screen. Having to navigate to it, and fiddle with filters is too many steps >> I don't feel rewarded. I was expecting to be building something; but the forest is just a stats screen."
"This app cannot be useful to me until it works with DAV synchronized task lists. For some reason it is able to load calendars from the DAVx app, but not Tasks."
Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.
More hierarchy on task options?
This app really help me.😊
This is the best. Why I give this 4 star? Because you need to be in premium to use the alarm thing
First forced me to sign in. Then took me to a Microsoft menu page instead of the list. Then kept me waiting for the to do list to load. No thanks. Even the clunky default notes app works better.
I love Habitica. It works to make the things I have to do at least somewhat rewarding and I can set fun goals for boring tasks.
Some lag in sync but otherwise good
thanks *n*
"There is a bug that resets the widget to display My Day when it is set to show Tasks. The only way to fix it is to remove and add the widget again. The drop-down to select what is displayed becomes unresponsive; and if the device was in dark theme, and is switched back to light theme, the widget stays stuck in dark mode."
"This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ... Hence the 4 stars , connecting to a student service such as UniDays would increase influx of student users."
"Life is like a video game. The free version: very detailed organization with a clean look, but well worth the time it takes to figure out."
"Respected Team, It is not working in oppo F5. Actually it is not reminding me despite off given all the permissions. Find out the solutions."
Good that i can link it across devices but i would very nuch prefer if there's a widget kind of thing which makes it easier to access
This is a great planner app. Only thing missing is the ability to rotate into portrait or even rotate 180 degrees.
"Task management is a bit dangerous (can forget to enable a list). Also, can't figure out a way to view a single list without disabling all other lists (which ties into first point)."
"Can I rate it zero? I spent time explaining support that new widget doesn't follow anymore default /system android theme. Before this ridiculous widget update it followed it and switched to dark mode automatically. Nothing fixed and only meaningless questions from, most likely, outsourced support is all I got. Note 10 Plus/Android 10/June security patch EDIT I do not use any custom launcher. Running stock firmware, totally"
"I've been using this app for more than 5 years, it was great. But currently I changed my phone and found out that syncing doesn't work anymore :( It says something like ""no internet connection"". So at the end I have to use another app."
Ok
Please remove the annoying and intrusive ads!!
"This is a re-review. This could be the best habit tracker, goal setter and task manager, with some really great features like nested lists and smart/auto grouping and a very versatile repeat task setup. Just don't confuse the 'game' in RPG for any actual gameplay; but it does have a very elaborate character design and advancement system, that deserves recognition, allowing for a well rounded and unique hero which grows with every task performed in the user's daily life. However Do It Now does hamstring itself by overlooking some very important integral functionality. Firstly there is no way to order the tasks set out in any of the groups. After a solid month of use, building some projects with subtasks which had subtasks, and setting up several habit based routines, the lack of prioritisation or task ordering created a confusing clutter of items which looked no different from the next. While auto-grouping and smart grouping should have been able to help sort that out the lack of ability for the user to remove any task from these groups meant every task appeared, once again losing the important ones in the clutter. User defined groups could only contain the items specifically placed in them- but once again a large project with a number of different aspects can not be ordered into a sensible linear series.. With no social aspect currently attached to the app (as at ver 2.23.0) there is no task sharing. There is also no designated pc/mac/linux front end for desktop syncing. Finally it's expensive as apps go. A one off of $75 will get the full version, or about $2.50 a month (paid yearly), which removes ads and gives calendar access. Original review: ""A good way to make the tedium of self regulation a bit more fun. Being able to plan to skip things when away from regular activities is handy. It would be nice to see characteristic and skill based modifiers affect related task improvements as they raise and subtask attached leader."""
Simple and nice. Can add up little more
I keep running into problematic bugs right away
I've tried a lot of to do apps... Like more to do apps than anyone should really try. This one is the best. It has everything I want EXCEPT the ability to change font.
Awesome app overall. It would be great to see some kind of progress functionality inside tasks. For example counter 0-10(or any other number you input) for push-ups / book pages / words learned etc.
"Doesn't work on my ASUS ZenFone 5 (ZE620KL) It doesn't show up whenever I 
add the widget in my home screen."
Ad heavy plus unable to use widget and stock calander app
"I love this app, I just wish it wasn't so easy to change your stats and I wish we could delete the default daily tasks. Maybe I can but I'm a dumbass. Idk"
I like the concept but the app itself is confusing to navigate and set up and is not very user-friendly.
it used to be a good app until they added the latest update which includes ridiculously annoying ads and frequent crashes.
"Nice app, but uses too much battery. It took 13h to drop from 100% to 75% and 8.7% of that drop was this app. Bit disappointing."
"Very Helpful, The Best Yet !"
Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.
"Been using for years. Just about to delete due to the full screen lengthy ads that not only appear when I add an event, they pop up when I'm using other apps. Did a scan using an ad detector app and Business Calender is the culprit. Shame as pervious ad style was OK, this is ridiculous though."
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app
"I am using the paid version and this is really good, love it. Quick question...I want to integrate this with the Samsung smart watch. Is this possible, otherwise deserves 5 stars. Please add option to integrate more than 1 outlook email calender Account and also themed design faces we can choose from for us who are bad at colors."
Kind of ha are to get the hang of. Maybe I'm just stupid! IDK!! But I never did figure it out...
Simple. Clear. Unobstrusive. But alignment and form of edited note does not mirror that of the saved note in the task list view.
I love this app.  I have always been a Franklin Covey planner gal and this is similar to the paper planner.  Great search function.
it was alright in the beginning but search bar disappeared after adding my tasks. guess there is bug who can't handle long task list. not recommending.
i had added a routine & by default it took a date almost 8 days ahead from today's date... i m unable to change the date... it's frustrating...
"Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks."
The event didnt sync to my other device
"There is no alarm bell, we will not be able to know when the time is up. Each and every moment i have to look at the time left .😣😏 Its more like reading less and looking at phone more🙄"
"Now hold on. I paid for the ""premium version"" a couple years ago for ad-free use. Decide to update the app for once and suddenly that's gone?"
Somehow bought it's own subscription? Then I had trouble cancelling. Was enjoying til it stole my money. I never saw any payment authorization window.
When we add sub-task it gets added too slow!
"This is a good app but the data analysis and visualization is fundamentally broken. The score and success percentage function in that they record the success values for the end of each day and then add that to the database. This means unfortunately that your success percentage never goes above your first day, when if you did the thing, you got 100%. As such, the visualizations are useless. A better solution would be to include rolling means of success percentage by x number of day intervals."
"Simple, intuitive, efficient"
ok but need to improve
"I liked it ,nic one. thanks!"
"What mess, can't undo a task if pop up is disappeared, this app is too overrated! Lean from ticktick...........!"
"The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested. But a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so I basically paid 32€ . THAT is a scam and unless I get my 17€ euros back I'm gonna keep the rating at one star. Edit: issue was solved and I got a refund for the extra money that was charged, all's well that ends well."
it 's good
"The *only* part of this app that doesn't impress me is the widgets, everything else is beautiful! Good visual layouts, simple quick tracking, but enough features to be flexible for different needs. UPDATE 12/30/2019: The app no longer syncs and does not import data. I've got a handy cvs export with 3,000+ lines of habit data, thank goodness, but can no longer reccomend the app if it requires manual input to restore data."
"I have been using this app for several years, I was absolutely happy with all the options it had in its free version. A few versions back, app started to drain my battery much faster and about the same time they added a really intrusive advertisement showing ads all the time when using it. I thought I will work through it, but no, it is very annoying, so I must say good-bye. When they stop with those ads, I will be happy to come back, but not like this. EDIT AFTER ANSWER FROM DEVELOPER: It is not true what they write - I get ads all the time, not just every 18 hours - probably because I am not villing to watch them till the end and then they always come back again. Also, skipping them via back button does not work. Very wrong concept of ads handling! No, thanks, already switched to another app."
uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current Google calendar.
it's a very good app I like how the to do list is categorized.
"Not able to get rewards in rewarded ad . Also the app gets crashed every alternate day , have to reinstall and log in every single time"
"I've tried so many different To do list and planning apps, but this is by far the best one. Easy to use, straight forward, and I love how it reminds you on Screen of what you have to do instead of just in the notification bar like most other apps do. Would highly recommend it, the free version is remarkable, but I got the paid version mainly to support the developers."
The app is really awesome Just one suggestion: If you could add an alarm notification prior to the events occuring then that would make it absolutely unmatchable I would like to add more suggestions just be in touch would sure share my experience
I like it. Paying month after month for premium features isn't for me though.
It is a lot better than the other apps out. An 8 or 16bit UI makeover would be dope. The pixel look and feel. Always nostalgic
I'm giving it only 3 stars because there's no support for CalDAV tasks sync
Too many clicks to do things. You need premium version for reminders
Love this app. Would like to say thanks for creating this app. Three star only because calendar is bit buggy. One is there are no real time syncing with google calendar which force me to use Ticktick's calendar which is not convenient for me.
"Provided apk installed, looks a bit better, but still has some delay after click on Complete from push notification. UPD4: no tasks duplication anymore. Delay between click on Complete and task movement to completed tasks list still occurs. Same delay happens when I mark task checkbox fron the tasks list, not only from push. When I snooze task, no such delay at all. UPD5: app hangs on switch betw. tomorrow and today. I have not enough spaces to describe cases there, may you share issue tracker?"
"Clear problem with sync multiple platform , it just made me crazy"
"It seems like this app is no longer supported. I've paid for premium, but sync stopped working several months ago, and developers have not replied to a support request. So - on moving to a new phone - my habits and streaks are now lost. I can see from other reviews that this is a widely reported issue. I guess the app has now been abandoned."
"Simple and easy to use app to schedule daily, weekly, and monthly tasks."
It's good but it's really difficult to login again when u reinstall this and forgot password. It's a big process to login again. There is no skip option to use it immediately and later login when got time.
Widget is slow
"I was using journal but can't write much until my hand gets better so I was looking for the app to plan my day preciously by time. Thought time line of this app would work, like all the icon and pre-made taps. But disappointed that I can not use those icons by itself for my event unless you creat another ""routine"" If dev's can modify the app that makes all those taps can be added to timeline by itself with my own time not only as events or routine, that would be perfect! Thanks"
"Engaging and effective. It doesn't seem to be possible to use a Google Play balance to pay for gems, though."
"I previously gave this app 5 stars. But current version receives 1 star less. I've been having problems with refreshing widget since I installed the app. But in all the previous versions it wasn't difficult to press the button ""refresh"". The current ver of widget doesn't have that button any more. The only quick way for refreshing is deleting widg and adding it again.. I guess I'll have to downgrade the app to previous versions:("
"App has been useful in helping me keep track of tasks and all, but lately the alarms I set on my dailies haven't been going off at all. Which is... unfortunate, because they're all to remind me to eat..."
It helped me
"Great concept, but there's issues with the widget, it shows nothing."
Perfect for all my brain junk and memos
You have to subscribe for the pro version. I'd rather just have one flat fee
Deep focus mode doesn't work properly. Please fix it.
"It's for me really useful, but I have a problem with the new species of trees, because when I try to unlock a new tree, it closes"
"Great app so far, still not sure about how everyting works...please can you create some warrior monk feature? (like shaolin rope, ecc.) Good job anyway!"
"First , suddenly app started crashing, when i reinstalled i couldn't log in or restore my purchase!!!!!"
So far so good..Im seeing if its worth paying for...Ive tried sooo many organizational apps.
Nice
Apparently syncs with Alexa but I can't get it to work. Disappointing.
Can't use it ofline. It would be better if available at offline also.Whenever i tried to access when network is not available it couldn't be accessed and the next time the app is asking to login again. Its really makes headaches.
Slows down my phone big time
Very good quality app for habits
"Glad I stumbled across this app. I don't change my home screen often (maybe once a year), but this one app convinced me to rearrange the whole screen to accommodate its widget, and I'm glad I did! The way the scheduling interfaces with the clock in the widget is something that should have been thought of a long time ago. Edit: I forgot to mention the watch face and app. I have used the same watch face now for 2 years. This app replaced my Pear watch face and I haven't looked back!"
"Lmao this app is so bad. Setting events is a pain, time zones don't work, the from time and to time of an event don't work. If you trust this app for your planning. I'm sure you'd go mad because of missing important meetings due to wrong time setting. Just use Microsoft Outlook etc and pay for it. This one is a waste of time"
"Cannot use because of the 299 entry limit. My most important list was split into 7 lists. The first list segment is full, so I cannot add a new entry to the top of it. I copied my lists from Wunderlist, and several lists got split like that. If it had copied starting at the bottom of the list so the first segment was the one not full, I might have been able to make it work."
"Since the last update, May 29, I have been losing random events. Tonight, I've added the same event four times over the last three hours. Just waiting to see if it disappears again. Several updates ago, the photos I attached to each profile stopped appearing. I think the OS was blamed. It's been a great app for several years but I'm afraid of what else I might lose in the near future."
"Its a good app to use for studying, but after using it for two hours, it sent me out of the app. Then, if i click the app, it wont let me in. I have tried downlaoding it three time but it doesnt work.. Please try to fix it.."
"Ad-free, sync with cloud, can manage recurring tasks (interface not suitable for beginners), widget is functional. Premium is very expensive, licence for home-use missing. However the free version misses some very basic features to force you to the premium. Greatest mistake: no way to backup / export my own data unless I pay. Don't be greedy - it is my data, and you lock it away. Missing auto backup in the free version is OK. But no way to export / download it is a no-go."
"Too annoying premium advertising, darkmode is premium only"
helpfull and easy to doung my to do list everyday
"Mostly works, but it's irritating when you have to log out and back in to force the lists to sync fully. Sometimes it doesn't even work so you have to do it multiple times. And there are times repeating tasks will randomly stop repeating. It's especially upsetting when you've removed over 100 tasks from one list and it isn't reflected on your other linked device, or if you share with another person and eat they see isn't synced."
Worst app dont install
"Thanks for your comments. Why does Google Calendar sync perfectly and BC not, when all on the same account, I think? Some while ago, possibly due to an update, this stopped syncing reliably either regularly or even when sync button pressed in Business Calendar menu. Deleting an event on this Samsung Galaxy phone sometimes forces a sync. Sync is important as I use this with Google Calendar on desktop. Previously wrote: Easy to use and great that I can copy appointments."
"I loved this app so much after I downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks. Because I loved it so much I decided to purchase the pro full version and payed £4.99. However, it was not worth paying at all. I would have rather used the free version with the ads. I will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the £4.99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra. I would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed."
My entire plan was suddenly removed
"Nice interface and easy to learn UX, good for keep your day on plan because it will help you to show what to do few hours ahead"
Good one to focus and encourage environmental resonsibility
"After installing the app, i check to see if my reacurring event would show up. And it did that one time. So minutes after i insalled i had to let it go."
Its good
"I don't think I've ever actually written a review for an app but felt compelled to say how brilliant Tasks is. Colourful, intuitive and organised. As someone who really benefits from structure but often finds productivity apps boring, this has been a game changer for me."
I've been using this since 2015.now with new phone. It didn't sync and expect me to upgrade again. Fix it please. Else. It will remain at 1 star. My feedback 👆🏼 posted few weeks ago was ignored. Uninstall for good!
Worst app ever. Showing no notufication for reminder. Pathetic. Useless.
Had high hopes for this because it had everything I wanted but the completed tasks that I keep putting as completed come back the next day which is just irritating. Have tried all the settings to get of it but I can't and can't be bothered to persevere anymore
Having moved from Wunderlist there are a few issues. With App you can't copy individual items in a list. If you do copy item which PC only allows notes box isn't copied but rearranged. Real hassle when a long list with notes attach to every item. There is also spacing issues with lists using App versus PC with group names & icon choice. Previous App worked & synced without glitches between devices
"It used to be a slick, minimal app that did what it needed to. Then they kept adding layers of unneeded features and forced people to make an account just to use it. No thanks."
Thanks a lot team.... Amazing customer service and response. Amazing app. Would recommend everyone.
I use it mainly for its widgets. ONE THING THOUGH: please fix the widgets so that the they show the current date and don't stay put on the previous day unless manually changed.
A good app. Love the concept. Helped me
Highly recommend simple useful application
"I think it's by far one of the best apps out there. It integrates well with the default calendar app, and really helps you to track your day. Tons of customizable buttons, and even the clock face itself from the hour/minute arms colour and thickness/length, to the placement of the numbers on the clockface. I love how it displays the time remaining to your next meeting, task or alarm. Widget is pretty good and you have full functionality from the comfort of your home screen. Lock Screen display??"
Easy of use.
Reminders doesn't work.
"It's great though you only get 100 habits in premium. Why not unlimited? 
Not a fan of a glass ceiling model. Whats more you cant remove this cap."
"I've only had this app for about a week but so far so good. No ads (as yet), very easy to use."
"Widget often becomes empty (after restarting of launcher, for instance). I have to open the app to make widget work. Note 10 + Apex launcher, Tab S6 + Samsung Home launcher."
"Widget is horrible. Keeps switching to ""my day"" and won't allow me to change it. Really expected better from Microsoft."
Honesty ! They said leave a review nd u will get a free plant ! So That's what i did ! Bye 👋
"List sharing sharing is not working. UX is straight from iOS app, terrible"
Very good app. It helps me a lot and it is very addictive as well. It will help you a lot for focusing and get your things done.. purely and truly satisfied 🤗
Уууу
"Very nice app that helps you organize your tasks and time. Links with Google calendar for the best experience. Has a pro version with a monthly payment, but is still very useful without."
It is very good app to manage your to do list. One thing that can make it better is it should show all the incomplete or overdue taks with todays tasks as overdue instead of into inbox. This will make those task more accessible and will keep them under notice.
awesome app .. i like the daily work and habit tracking .. thanks guys
Really cool app.
Good
Very bad
By far this is the best to do list app I have used . But I have 2 issues with new widget. First :I can't press the icon and go to the app like I used to. The icon is gone now . And second: the font is too small .really hard to read my list .
Still exploring the app but so far so good
"Very useful app, many features!"
This site is most suitable for those who wanted to get a jobs from home Thanks a lot
"I deleted a list but I still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list, even after restarting my phone."
"If you keyword search, there is no sort. You end up with search results in random order, which is basically worthless, at least to me."
"İ am a business owner in Azerbaijan, so my employees are not used to using alot of technology yet. I tried using other apps but they were to complicated for my team. But Any.do is really easy to use and less complicated. We use it as personal organiser but also as a company coworking platform. Really great app that i can recommend to small and medium size businesses, but u can also use it as a personal organiser. Also it is great that this app has many different language portals"

"I liked the app, it was missing a few things but It was okay. I uninstalled it at one point, until I decided if I wanted to keep it, but I am still getting notified for the reminders. It is incredibly annoying and I can't figure out why... Edit: Thanks for the help, the problem is now that I don't know what account I logged in with."
I really like the visual round of this app however I would love to be able to personalise it more easily...
There's nothing you can find fault with this app. So useful and user friendly. It's worth more than 5-star
Does not repeat every two days as set. Pretty damn useless. Uninstalled.
Pretty good for taking task and reminders. Gives a lot more things other apps don't give and you don't have to pay money in order to have basic app settings.
I was unable to understand anything..... This app is a big mess
"I missed the old tiny tree that was at before for 10 minutes of focusing, I truely missed it 💔"
I would love it if my calendar would sync across by devices. And my tasks & notes synced. Its disappointing because I enjoy the simplicity of the format; its user friendly. But iy doesn't work for me since I can't sync all devices.
"This app simply changed my life!!! From day 1! Thank you so much!! And I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to form daily habits, but laziness or lack of discipline gets in the way... This app will sort you out and it's fun to tick everything off as ""complete"" as the day goes on :)"
"My all around power app! This app has been so useful, that I use it not just for tasks but also my calendar. Used to sync with Google calendar, but left that to be all Ticktick now. This app is right on the money."
"I really like this app - its a lovely interface, simple to use and very useful to have both tasks and notes with the calendar. Is there any possibility of adding a folder/tag/category function to the notes?  It would be so helpful - I make notes on a varietu of things as I go along, and its really useful to be able to store them by day, but it would also be great to be able to sort them by tags or folders. Anyway - just a suggestion. Otherwise a lovely app. Thanks :-)"
Worst only useful when you are using premium
"Sorry this is not a review but a question : anything I enter in google calendar ends up in any.do, but not the other way around ? How do I do this ? Have I missed something ? Specifically, I want my Goggle Home mini to be able to tell me what's on my any.do tasks and calendars."
I liked this app so much I actually paid for the full version. Extremely helpful in reminding me about where my priorities should lie
"Creating an account is supposed to ALLOW you, not FORCE you. Uninstalled without trying it"
The free version is crippled. 3 lists max. Seriously? Just use DTG GTD. To do app with free unlimited nested to-do lists with tags and reminders.
I created a task where I set the repeated option 5 times/day but after clicking 1 time on the task it goes to next day. But I set it 5 times/day!
The tasks doesnt show up on time and it always overdue and i dont get to finish my important tasks. I have to find another one ... To do list app This app sucks..
"The app is great. There are so many features. Actually, you create your own game. I didn't notice any ad even with a free account. You can donate 1 dollar to support developers with cup of coffee :) Edit: Still love the app. Enjoy your coffee, Taras! ;)"
"Solid calendar app that works like a calendar should. I switched to this app from Google Calendar because I used to travel across 4 timezones for work, and I got tired of having to re-adjust all of my scheduled meetings each time I entered another timezone. I haven't looked back since switching."
Missing everything good about gtasks and adds everything you hate about every other task list app.
"I ended up using a third party task list. A few of the problems: 1. can't manually reorder tasks by dragging and dropping. 2. tasks don't have duration so you can't block out time on your calendar to do the task. 3. The worst one - if you want to view one task list, it turns off reminders for all other task lists unless you remember to turn the view on for all the others...and, as you can see from the reply below, this is ""standard behaviour"", so, interpret that how you will ;)"
Useful
It sucks🖕🖕
Enjoying this app. Simple & easy to use. Visual didplay helps me to stay clear on commitments & time constraints
"Really loving this app! I've used a couple other productivity apps but this is the first one I've really stuck too. Turns out failing tasks and losing points really motivates me. Was wondering if it's possible to get bonus points for completing tasks in succession? Think it would help with habit formation. Otherwise does everything I need it to and really happy with it, great job!"
Really like it. Would love to be able to manually resize appointments and add new appointments into arcs with free time.
The app used to work perfectly now it lets me do anything without the tree dying I apologize for two stars but the problem is very annoying
"Extremely Disappointed. I had been a faithful user of this app and loved it. Then all of sudden everything changed. There is no cloud support. The tabs option is gone. There is no interface with established tasks list. I have tried and tried to use. I contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance. I had uninstalled this app, however I felt I needed to write thos review. After I finish this, uninstalling this app. Useless to me."
Won't connect to server. Will rate better when this issue is fixed. I'm using a Samsung Galaxy Note 8
Very helpful for me to visualise my schedule It boost up my motivation and efficiency 🔥🔥🔥
"Seems alright so far but since there's not a single setting for notifications, easy 1 star. Some lists I'm part of, i don't want or need notifications every single time something is added. Add notification settings for a higher rating. Something that shouldn't even need to be asked for. Not fixed still, plus widget doesn't update with restart. Stays blank on ""my day"" can't open it"
I really like it. But there's one or two thing's that need to be addit. I Personally use it to make a list of book that planning to buy and read this year i know there's other apps for this but love the check list style but i don't like how it get deleted after 30 day at most it will be great if there is Option for never delete Plus adding a imagine option will be nice like wallpaper behind the task name
Really useful and well designed app - only thing I feel that is missing to make it five stars is having a shopping list widget
"Perfect for list making. Only thing I would do is let people have more customization options to make their lists more creative, but other than that it is a solid app I use daily."
"Just migrated to Tick Tick - it's better with more holistic useful functionality and cheaper with free version having not that much restrictions like in Todoist. Sorry guys, it seems you have some work to do if you want to stay competitive."
Interesting alternative to combined calendars and notes. Very visual approach that allows to focus on what matters. Time is a scarce and unvaluable commodity. Let's manage it as it should !
"Good app, but no updates even after sending few suggestions. What is the point in buying Paid version."
Good app. Sadly it onlt worked for a day. Now it crashes instantly.
"This app used to be great when paired with Alexa. Every once in awhile the sync would break but disabling the app and relinking the account would fix the issue. This has not been the case for the past several months. Any.do it is no longer syncing with Alexa and based on the reviews of the Alexa app it is affecting a lot of people, has been ongoing for weeks, and there doesn't appear to be a fix coming. Going to give anylist a try to see if it works with Alexa."
Not bad but looking for something better!!!
"Awesome... Been using this app (paid version) for about 6 years. It has never failed me and has never, in my opinion.. had a bad update. Gets better all the time... Big thanks to the developers and maintenance peeps...."
"Can't attach photos, says photo too large on Android, and on iPhone it just fails"
This is by far the best and complete Todo list app i have come across so far... However the notification and alarm feature doesn't work... Would have gotten a 5 star from me if that had worked. Thank you.
"FYI, Adding more reminders is not free. You need to buy the premium version."
Helpful with sorting out my day
"The grocery list is not syncing properly and is missing items that my wife added on her phone. This has caused issues for us where I've missed items when shopping. This is particularly bad considering the current quarantine and the fact that I have to queue up to get into the shop in the first place. I've tested and when I add the item ""snacks"" on my wife's phone they don't appear on my grocery list. I can not recommend this app currently because of this."
"Thanks, amazing. Took a little while to figure out how routine worked with program, but I think I understand it now. Love how you can tweak everything and integrate it into the homescreen background. Love the icons in de bar as an option. Really useful, but non intrusive app. Good value for money. Would absolutely recommend it for anyone who thinks Google calander lacks a few functions or is really bad at organizing or routines."
"Thanks to the developer for your quick response, however, this calendar is useless for our group without those features...we decided to go with Business Calendar Pro. Previous comments: Wasn't able to see month or year view"
Want use only not sharing
"Almost what i need, except there's no option to set a start & end time with reminder for the start. So it's useless (for me)."
This is the beat app of all !!!!
"Love it, but it has some major flaws: (1) Can't personalize THEME. (2) Can't configurate WIDGETS' toolbars & what details are displayed. (3) The widget's size is too wide—max 4x?. Would love it if it were more flexible. (4) You cannot sort the notes on one day to be listed in ALPHABETICAL order on the Day widget; it will always be sorted by time. (5) The app malfunctions when you place two widgets on the home screen. (6) App stops working a lot for seemingly no reason."
"App is cool on the surface but has some things that could be improved on. For example, some things just aren't finished or stop working. In a couple customization menus there isn't an option to take off accessories while that option is available in others. Menus suddenly stop working and you have to close and reload the app to fix it. There is no in depth tutorial and a lot of stuff is up to you to figure out which can be confusing because the User Interface isn't always clear."
Have given all permissions yet unable to turn on deep focus mode. Plus the link that's supposed to explain permissions leads to a 404.
I have paid to upgrade this app as I find it great using over years. However I wasn't able to transfer the paid pro version to my new cellphone. What do I need to do to recuperate?
Update 2/19/2020: I cant recommend this app to anyone. The smart date parsing only works reliably if you enter it using military time. Also the fact that you have to enable alarm mode to have reminders fire on time is ridiculous. I have many apps that push notifications on time and don't require that. So the developers don't know how to do reminders correctly. Horrible app.
"Why can't I set a task to be done 3 times a week, anyday during the week? Most of my tasks are like that. UPDATE: Okay. I'll try that. Thanks.."
"What is going on? The app says ""server connection lost"""
"A new ""feature"" of Microsoft To Do compared to Wunderlist is notifications being cleared at the start of every new day. This is incredibly annoying because if I don't have time to get to it, I want it to be a constant annoying reminder so I know to get around to it. I would rather continue to use Wunderlist, if the recurring tasks was implemented offline, instead of requiring the server to give you a recursive task."
"Bug is there in recent version, whenever i try to mark incomplete a task a duplicate task comes up with same name again and again. Also we cannot recover our mistakenly deleted task"
"Not sure what the point is when you can still access any app without interrupting your trees as long as you leave this running in the background? Note: the ""lock forest to stay in foreground"" option is selected"
"Was excited for this app. But the fact I can't change the notification 
alarm is a deal breaker."
"It's fairly easy to use, however the alarm  doesn't  work"
It os the best app I ever had. It is wonderful. I love it!!!!!🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿🤘🏿😀😀😀😀😀😀😀😀
I love it but theres one thing you should add. A note pad for notes for extra.
"Had a great experience when I was using it thru browser but when i installed it on my phone, it wouldnt record all my progress and tasks on my phone application. Even with the same account. Please work it out, I would love to keep using thru my phone."
I have downloaded it 4 times because the app opens only on the day of download...the very next day it won't open n i have to install it again
Good but it veberates and dose not make noise
One of the worst in the genre
"I tried adding the pro for $7.99 because I thought you could set daily reminders by just marking repeat daily it doesn't do that or any of the things I was hoping for, I have had it less than 24 hours and would like a refund, I have sent emails asking for help and haven't received anything back so I just want my money back and this app gone!"
"Not what I was looking for, I saw there was a time it would remind me I 
thought it would work but non of them did so that sucked"
Just add 'To Do List' feature. Highly recommend.
Haven't found how to sync between two devices yet!
Very nice app . It is helping me organize my work and follow a schedule. It has helped me to learn the value of time. I recommend this app to all those who want to stay well organized and follow everything time to time . I would like to say thank you to the app developers and the editors and everyone who helped create this app . Thank You
How do i unsubscribe this useless app?
"app has improved a lot since initial launch and it's still my go-to for my daily tasks! still hoping for more social features in the future. also, there is still the lingering issue with a surprising amount of battery use, i think it's still related to the amount of tasks i have (i have a very busy schedule), and it causes my phone to overheat. keep up the good work!"
nice but I wish it had more flexibility.
Sometimes the app will just stop working or the widgets won't work
"Feel like I'm getting things done, when they are off the list"
✔️This App has all the features and customisation required in a Task Mgmt app. And the developer is proactive. ❌ What freaks me is doubts about data security as the company is based out of Hong Kong.
"Generally good but has issues, adding a subtask is just weird - why they can't do what wunderlist does with a place to add or a button, and it's all a bit sluggish with some redraw problems. But it has some great ideas to it, so maybe it'll be good in time."
"Out of all the RPG themed productivity apps out there, this one has certainly met my needs. To whoever who comes up with the idea and design of this app, you certainly created a miracle for a guy like me! Thank you so much for creating this app, dear developers! P.S. I'll be giving this app a proper review one day, after a few weeks / months of using this! :) Till again, you've certainly created a great future for me, through this app man! 😭"
"I am well please with this app. If you are interested in quality productivity app with simplicity, then it is Tick Tick."
Helpful with reminding me of things that need to be done
The app is fairly simple and works for my needs. It's also been very reliable on my Pixel 3.
"Update Aug 2020: I've been using this app for over 3 years now and I still love it! Previously I had probably tried every calendar app on the market, switching every few months. Love that BC2 combines my calendar and tasks in one place. I also love that it is fully customizable so I can get the exact look I want for the app and widgets. I honestly can recall a time when the app glitched or had issues! The developers take good care of this app (thank you!)!"
"Fantastic app, would be nice if it had a calendar feature though."
App is good but have some error it's no refresh automatically on widget home screen we have to open app to refresh apps hour line please fix tht error
It was ok
Piece of poo
I don't know how useful this will be yet. But I should point out that subscribing to your Instagram shouldn't be an infinitely repeatable task xD
Cannot use without existing calendar
Pretty basic. Orders alphabetically but not according to user's preferences.
For me it frequently stops syncing. I currently can't get it working again. But when it was working it was great.
Helpful features but not everything accessible on app version
Nearly perfect for daily usage. Is there a way for widget do display tasks hours I think this would be massive help for the users?
"I wish widget would have a very compact design, just a list of tasks, nothing more -- no menu bar, no headers, etc. As for me, the widget eats too much of homescreen space and is not optimised."
"I can't use the desktop app for windows. It won't let me sign in with my google account. Please fix this. Furthermore, some more themes for both the phone app and desktop app; Also, a feature where the user can attach progressive pictures that correlate to their habit, would be nice,as well for premium users. If I can have 99 attachment a day on premium, why not this suggestion?"
"been using todoist for some months now great app but need to make the google home experience better. it would be great if it would ask to set a time and date and would i like to change the title of the context when it asked if you would like to change the context, add a label and move to a different project."
I have one old version backup file and now it is not getting restored. Please help
It's ok
"Requires account to use.   I was just giving a simple reason why I didn't like it. But since your response indicates I don't have 10 seconds, then I'll waist 5 minutes to make you understand.  The point is that it ""Requires An Account""! I don't need another stinking account to keep track of a task list. If I wanted to share on multiple devices, I would just use any number of desktop applications that I already own. I don't need another stinking program tracking my business in the sake of ""backing up my data' or make it available everywhere. I have that covered already.  Just wanted a simple task list for a small price to use on my phone. But without that choice, no thanks. To act as though 10 seconds to give up my privacy is no big deal, well my information and data is not your business or any one else unless I decide I want to do that. That is what you need to understand, some customers like to have options to do something and not have something stuffed down their throat. Downloaded ""Tasks: Todo List"" and been happy with it. Donated $1.99 to developer for making app for me and not their self."
Not able to install on more than two devices. I found this frustrating as I had one phone stolen and another broke. Now I can’t download on my new phone because it’s already on the other with my main email. Does not allow another email. Not too pleased about this.
Have been paying for premium each month for several months now and now it's not syncing across devices and its telling me to upgrade to premuin on both fone and 2nd device when iam paying for premium (pathetic)... Canceling subscription and uninstalling!
Apps been broken from the moment I download need fixing
"Works great, easy to move unfinished tasks. why the 3? because they want 3 dollars a month to review completed tasks. there are others out there that don't charge."
"I miss having what used to be starred items organized by the file they are listed under. Now its one massive Iist under important. While the category is there, it was so much nicer under Wunderlist. Please, I hope you bring that feature back. Thank you."
"I like the app, very helpful for lots of things, however I've lost my account twice. I've had to uninstall it and recreate my account. Very good otherwise tho"
"This is a great app, I really enjoy using it! There are a few minor bugs here and there, but nothing serious that prevents functionality. You can access Guilds to chat with people about various topics and check off everything you need to do in a day with a little helpful motivation from party members. Definitely would recommend this app for those who are motivated for the next level up!"
"If you want to use it properly, you have to pay for the Pro version. It is not user-friendly."
"What happened to the setting for choosing how far in the future to sync calendars? The app on my phone is only showing events for 1 month in the future, and then the calendar is blank. There are many events much further out than this, that I can no longer see on the app. I've been through the entire menu tree and no longer see the setting for length of time to sync."
Good app but its not notifying me in my new phone LG but my old phone it does ring can someone tell me how to fix this problem ? The habitNow team helped me fix the problem it was the feature of battery optimizer on my phone thank you great app!
Super💯
"The app design looks nice, and has good features. This is a functional planner app. I can access the week view in the free version (though a prompt to upgrade to premium pops up), but tasks cannot be set as recurring in the free version. This is a main feature I'm looking for in a planner app. Also, the look of the app cannot be customized- stuck forever with that purple at the top of the screen. There are other free apps that include these things."
I love it. But too expensive.
This is so complicated it took me awhile to to figure all the stuff. I would suggest add some tutorial on YouTube so anyone can get used to it. and the app is solid and will think about purchasing the pro version.
"The App is just awesome. Loved it. Very useful for daily planning and keeping records of day to day work. Nice app. I am using it for past one month. Those who are searching for a good app for day to day work purposes, must try it. It's completely ad free.."
Really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app. Will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app (there are plenty) big mistake by the developer!
"Two bugs right at the beginning of registration. First two images didn't load on the three slides intro, then when registering my info, it moved to the next screen but gave a name error and I couldn't make an avatar. Not a good first impression. Just deleted my account thru the website."
"LOVE LOVE LOVE its so perfect for what i need! 1.some more icons would be great if possible or even the ability to add our own image as an icon would be amazing! 2.i reccomended this to an ios user (who was very keen after i showed them)and they couldnt find it, if this hit apple products this app would be used by everyone thanks for making this because its not often you get a great UI, great graphics and such amazing functioning in an app :)"
"Everything about this app is perfect! Except for the widget support. The widget doesn't update with the new tasks I make in the app. And I wish I could mark tasks as complete right from the widget. I would also like to be able to make multiple notifications for one task, or set one task to repeat multiple times a day. I also wish the notification for the mission would show up every time. Great start"
great app. love it
too tricky. complicated ..not immediate.. maybe isnt what i need...i need something more simple..
"Forever Landscape? Why can't I ever get this app to rotate to portrait mode? It's never been able to do this, even after downloading it on other phones. Way too annoying to have to deal with for me to deem it a useful app, at least for me."
don't have option for Windows surface pro
This thing is terrible I couldn't do anything I wanted
"*Update* 11/02/20 USE AT YOUR OWN RISK! As expected, no contact from developers. App has not been updated since 2018. This app was great for a month until it kept freezing my phone. A de/reinstall has now lost all my data and looking at other users with this issue, it looks like it is lost forever because of the sync function never working and no contact from developers. Very upset and disappointed."
"Give us options I was dismayed to discover that the latest update decided to move all my completed tasks on a list to the bottom - and they are in a reverse sort order. For most of my lists I liked seeing all the items together. I can see possibilities with this new view, but please let the user choose."
Why isn't this app getting downloaded There is some issue with the app It had been recommended to me by my buddy but this thing isn't getting installed on my phone
Nice visualization of personal activities
Handy visual aid! Highly recommend as a tool for managing time blindness for ADHD.
"Feature request: I hope I can manually reorder tasks in label views like it's done in project views. Of course, to be synchronized across all platforms. This will be cool."
This kind of chart planner is created to be colourful and is totally clear for us to accomplish our daily task .It s was interesting to have this tool with me so that i can focus on my job accordingly with time. thank you. It s good tool for everyone without paying a penny .
Good
"When you create a task and then set a reminder, you have to go back to the text and press enter otherwise it doesn't save it, or even warn you if you navigate away. Caught me out a few times, seriously annoying so looking at other options. Other than that it's ok but nothing special and the views are a bit odd. All for example doesnt actually show all tasks!"
It is great....
"I wanted to give the app more stars as I love the concept, but it's so buggy. Especially with the dailies feature... all the dailies are linked together somehow. There are some things I do Mon-Sat for instance, but not on Sundays. But when I set a task to not repeat on Sunday, it sets all tasks that way. Very frustrating."
expensive
"The website boasts that any.do is the best grocery list app for Android Wear. Lies. There is no way to view lists on Android Wear, only add tasks. You can view lists on Apple Watch. This is the feature I need and I guess I'll look elsewhere."
"To Do list cant be shown on widget. Only the myday can be, which i dont want to use. There are better options. microsoft refuses to use common sense agsin with this app. Your to do item needs to be less than about 15 words in order to view it. while editing the item you can write 50 words or more, but after saving you cant view it completely because the scroll doesnt function well enough. 75% of the screen real estate (like most microsoft sw) is wasted."
Really cool app. Helps you focus if you are always on your phone/ screens. You can plant a virtual tree and if you go on an app it dies. All the trees you plant are put in your personal forest. The more you concentrate the more coins you get and your can buy sounds and different trees. If you pay you can use your coins to plant trees in the real world. I highly recommend this app to anyone.
"Unresponsive widget, did not work at all on my phone."
"I love this program could be 5 stars BUT... a task adds Tick Tick to the shared text in the paid version. This not good and means you have to remove it every time! WORSE IS THE Developer response I got below, clearly indicates they do not understand usability issues reported from good users. "" You can remove the TickTick information manually."" REALLY!!! Not a good suggestion for a productivity product."
"£3 a month to use most of the app... Na. Features are nice, but Disappointed I can't just buy the app."
Not easy to use. And doesn't do a good job of keeping reminders
Interesting and promising but not refined or intuitive. Chat function is one of the worst I've ever encountered.
Couldn't get the rest of my calendars to appear. Feedback help wasn't clear as well. Uninstalling
Its good☆
Great app but will have to uninstall if they don't sync with google calendar or include a calendar!
"Crashes too often PS: Yes, my app is updated and yes, I am a pro user. This is an issue many of my friends have also faced. PS: 8/7/2020. Welp crashed AGAIN."
"I have to uninstalled this app on my phone soon i open the apps and trying to make things to do list.. it worked fine just i have trypophobia and those small circles/dot just freaking me out... edit, the small circles/dots that i mean here is when i click new list next we fill the LIST NAME and it appears with small circles/dots in color for me who's having this kind of phobia that kind of design is just scary.. aside of that your apps seems to be simple and easy to use."
I loved this app but it keeps crashing lately when I try to buy new trees
"Having to find players to be able to do anything is a bit annoying, it's really boring otherwise. Reminders don't work properly - I set a bunch for last night that never happened, and a bunch this morning that never happened. It's not really built for proper daily routines including things you need to do twice per day so... It's not really useful for me."
Good app. However the notification has stopped working.
It keeps crashing on my android device. In every 24 hours i have to uninstall and reinstall the app to use it. The error message pops up stating that this app keeps closing.
True a unsnecessarypts at r
"Was fine until the last couple of days when the layout turned squirrelly on my Android tablet.  Seems okay on my smart phone.  Still, I will not purchase full version unless the version for my tablet goes back to matching the screen layout on my cell."
Best to do list app except the new notifications have gone haywire. They only pop up at bottom of screen and then disappear if I open any other app. Old standard Android notifications would remain in pull down notification drawer until I dealt with it - far superior. Please bring that back.
It's not even logging in post the intial screen and I downloaded it just now. LAME!!!
Need a combination for habits and dailies
"A fantastic and helpful app became useless with the last update. Grouping open and completed tasks may be helpful for some, but for some types of lists it would be really handy to have all tasks together. For example a picking list (or shopping list) with the items sorted in order of their position in the warehouse. You do not need everything every time, so you can just uncheck the items when needed during a round, possibly hiding the completed tasks to minimize screen cluttering. This was possible before, but with the recent update(s) all completed tasks have moved to a separate list. All custom sorting is lost. Dear Microsoft, please re enable these features. You could provide an option in settings to use one or the other. (Maybe even on a list level) 2 stars because it used to be a good app, otherwise I would have now given it only 1 star."
"Super app with horrible widget. You can mistakenly complete a task by clicking on widget, and it's gone without you even noticing it. Free apps have better widget honestly."
Eh....not great for an expensive app. One of my important tasks went missing. I asked for help but response hasn't produced the lost task yet...
The app does not let me create a widget despite the fact that I have logged in ☹️
"Excellent app, they greatly improved the quality since last time I used it. I'm a user of the web page for 5 year now, and the app was a little outdated but know it is very complete and useful. Thank you!"
I was testing this to replace Fabulous. So far the notifications are not persistent enough. Fabulous is able to wake me up in the morning.
"I love this app, it's the only one that looks and feels like the old Franklin planner, however; since the latest update I have a banner ad on the bottom of the screen with Google ads and I am a paid pro user. This is extremely annoying. If they don't remove this, I'm leaving."
"does not work properly , does not update wit hcalendar entries , worst thing , cannot aak my money back!!!!!!!"
Always reliable when I needed it. Easy to use.
An extremely helpful app
"Decent, but premium features like Sync do not work, can't even reimport data you exported yourself. Had I realized this I would have never have bought the app, it's just false advertising. I now have to figure out how to port my data to another app where it won't be inevitably lost."
awsome application.. i purched it.. but i just want notifation should be blinking on phone like alram clock .. plz add this type of features.. the thing diplys in notifaction should be flash on main screen From last 10 month it's not getting synchronising.. Plz do something @developer We paid for it
Was good. But no longer updating real time...
"The interface is incredible! It's the perfect organizational app I've always been looking for. This is all overshadowed for me however by the fact that it is automatically attached to your email with no way to remove it. I would use this app daily if it would just exist in it's own bubble without needing to grab onto 3+ emails. Minor complaint but it really turned me off from the app, and if I had known this I would not have used it in the first place."
"Just installed and trying out (I'll update along with my experiences). UI/UX is pleasant and clear. Looks promising. Love the Free full-featured & Premium accessory-features philosophy; I'll pay later on to support development. ISSUES: 1) can't change start-date & repetition of a habit; if it'll break history data, at least allow duplication 2) would expect SCHEDULED days to be colored/marked in the single habit calendar, as future overview; not just as achievement overview. ## So far, good job!"
BEST TO DO LIST EVAAAA!!!!!!
I would rate this app 5 stars except I hate the way it scrambles all your tasks every time you change time zones. It's absolutely maddening if you have a lot of tasks because you'll be forced to re-priotitize every time. Going coast to coast with a layover and you'll be doing it three times. Ugh. [Update] Constantly crashing on my Galaxy Note 9 now. Like 20+ times a day.
"I constantly get a message "" problem with the server "" please fix this, I liked the app a lot but I am unable to use it cause it doesn't connect nor update my tasks"
"Unless you put ticktick widgets on home screen, the app won't be as effective to improve your productivity. Awesome app, now I am using my time in more productive activities and everything is in organised format. Happy to have such apps which can help for self growth."
Great app. I wish I had more chance to add reminders without buying premium.
So far so good! It does do this weird thing where it highlights a different app after I've exited the app though... bit of a weird bug.
"Good app,,i know ,my feiend has suggeaed to download it,but my sumsung galaxy tab doesnt optimize this apo in my device so,i am very sad"
hi! the reminder feature is not working/ supporting in my phone. Also if possible please add support in your app to contact for bugs. thank you.
I loved this calender but it's really disappointing how often I add something and the next day it's disappeared.
"Cash grab, and nothing more. Purchased the app a year ago but now due to an issue on the account being asked to pay for it again. Very disappointed and no response from seller. Last update was 1 year ago so as far as I am concerned the developer abondoned it."
"Advertises that you own your data and you can export your progress. In reality, they don't let you access that feature without a premium membership. I don't mind paying for features and services, but keeping your data behind a paywall is dirty. I'd recommend finding a FOSS habit tracker."
Looks good. But doesn't have web version. Would be 5 stars if I was rating author's dedication. Functionality wise can't give more than 3. The app is inferior to Any.do or microsofts todo
"I used this all the time, and it's good, but it'll be more dear if it's supports split screen and rotated screen"
"Subscription based calendar, immediately uninstall it"
"You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed."
please add night mode! I study at night and the bright green screen hurts my eyes. Realluy consider this as an option tha many of us who use this app prefer a less bright screen that is better for the eyes.WE WANT NIGHT MODE!!
Not bad
Good app
"Can only track 5 habits, but there are discussion forums. Most of the forums have no activity going on, but there are still a few users to talk to. Often times the app no longer syncs me to them, just like right now. The quotes have been stuck, too. Developers no longer support this app. Do not buy the premium version, as you will NOT be able to sync across devices. There are no more updates or customer support. This could have been the absolute best habit tracking app. So much wasted potential."
Overall Best Hebit tracker app - Need improvements in app ui [ For better touch experience ] [ Dark theme not up to mark ]
I dont get it in google callender i set a goal to run 4:30 every morning but why on earth is it so that the app sets time on its own and when i edit it it is edited only for one day not the others
"It was awesome , but they started ads. Now im switching to another app."
You create good think bt every option you when i use just close it and subscription to much price 350 par month os is really....
"The app itself is pretty good. My issue came from having difficulties canceling my subscription. I described everything I was doing to try to do it, what I was seeing instead of the option to unsubscribe, etc. The solution suggested did not help, so I described the situation further. The next response came from a different person, who suggested a method I had already mentioned was not working for me. After I replied again, I never got another response. I just figured out what the issue was, but I couldn't do so before getting charged again. Disappointed in the customer service."
"I like it at lot, but it seems like recently, this v thing is taking out my battery, hogging memory, and using data more than chrome which I use constantly. Until someone can help me figure this out, or if this high usage of phone resources is normal, I can't rate it any higher. I might even have to remove it and search for an alternative."
Leave it to Microsoft to screw up Wunderlist. I used it for my show notes while I was out and about. I could input my note and it would go to the top of the page. Now it goes through the bottom and I have to drag every single note to the top. It's annoying.
"Since the last update. there's too many adds. Which wasn't there earlier. and before it would physically stop you from opening other apps, kindly bring that feature back."
Romantic
Everything is a premium feature. Everything else is a basic list
I don't friggin know yet. I JUST installed it. Note. I haven't spent any time on it!
Don't like the app and trying to unsubscribe but there is no option
"Has many nice features but they lack polish - 1. Has notifications like TickTick but unlike TickTick, you'll have to unlock the phone for you to see it. 2. Has a grocery list where you can add things but you cannot add quantity.. And many others..."
Smart input while editings tasks should be same as when creating tasks.
"Overall, it's pretty darn good. The only problem I have with the app right now is that the crown doesn't work for scrolling. Please integrate this simple feature for five stars."
Would like option to have rounded corners in the widget. Love that it's the most customisable calendar I have tried.
"The app is useful on the phone and tablet. I purchased it believing that it would also work on my smartwatch as displayed in the pictures. You will only get reminders, not a watch face. The picture of the smartwatch is misleading. Either develop the watch face app or remove the picture of it."
That app is good but I could not benifit
Helpfully to manage task and sharw with team
"Best Todo list app, still had areas for improvement, but I haven't found anything that is better."
"the best to do app i've ever used, i tries anydo for a long time but this was the easiest and the most convenience. To be honest, i didnt expect microsoft to make something this satisfying, sorry Bill ;)"
Kinda complicated. Still not used to it. I love the widgets though.
"So disappointing!!! I used to love this app bit over the last few months it is Sooooooo glitchy! I just spent an hour deleting and checking off tasks from my to do list and everytime I think Im done, they show back up in triplicate!! Everything I changed IS STILL THERE AFTER AN HOUR!!! DOES THAT SOUND LIKE A GOOD TIME MANAGEMENT PROGRAM????? AND NO WAY TO CONTACT SUPPORT BECAUSE WHEN I TRY TO GET TO THE MENU IT SHOWS A BLACK SCREEN!!!!!"
"The idea behind the app is good. Although, after paying for premium, the promised cloud sync does not work (several users mention the same issue). There is no way of backup the data either. I cannot see any feedback from devs here. Switched to a different app: ""Habits."""
I lived Wunderlist and although To do should work the same there is something about it that just isn't as enjoyable. F. X. It's soooo dark 😳
"Decent app, but forced to pay for basic features. Not enough customization for tasks"
Higher app
I m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building.Let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get Dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward.
"Good design, but it's not exactly free if you have to pay for basic features, like reoccurring events."
"I had previous mentioned a glitch in the wedgit, it's been 5 months and was told that a team was working on the glitch. So far there has been no improvement. It's a good app without appropriate maintenance hence the bad review."
updated:. was confused that the event list in the actual app wasn't showing events scheduled for the next few days. The widget will only show events in the next 12h. The event list in the app also only shows events in the next 12h. I think this list should list events for that entire day. this means i still depend on other apps for an agenda view.
Tried to put in my first event and it failed to log it. I uninstalled it same day.
It's almost perfect. The widgets on homescreen need more options. A list of events for the day instead of only the monthly view is a necessity. Add it and I'm sold!
"I need to track not only good habits, but also bad. With this app it is impossible. I don't want to smoke AT LEAST two times in a month or greater to reach my goal, I want to smoke NO MORE THEN two times in a month or less for success"
Love this app!! I'm much more organized with it!
"I love all the recent changes you have made - especially the ability to undo things in the history. Could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks? I would like to put mine in the order that I do them throughout the day, and none of your sorting allows that. Thanks! Update: it's been 22 months since you said you'd make drag and drop sorting an option. I see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly. Don't promise what you won't deliver."
"Pretty good, but won't sync with Outlook cal and pop-ups every so often."
"Several navigation options are inaccessible because they're underneath the home/back/tasks buttons at the bottom or within the notification/notch area at the top, making this app hard to use on my phone."
No Google tasks integration.
Please remove the annoying and intrusive ads!!
"A little hard to use at 1st. However, if you go through the tutorials. The app will help you develop habits. I have been using it for a month and am definitely noticing a difference. If you want to change your habits, download this app."
"Good for notes, needs export, email options"
"Doesn't work at all - as a developer myself, it's clear they don't know what they're doing. It should have every possible one but doesn't have ANY broadcast receivers or persistant notification to keep it alive from Android oom freeing up memory which explains no-one receiving notifications as seen in other reviews. Even when active, notifications only received upon screen on despite battery optimization execlusion or doze completely disabled with root. 5 stars and will subscripe once fixed."
"This is terribly buggy and you're better off avoiding it; use the website instead, if you're on your mobile device. Latest update doesn't update habit counters on-screen after you press any buttons; all of the command is processed though. App still doesn't display items that are found. Just another buggy update."
Not very user friendly.
Great app 👍 could you please add the option to view habits on the tommorow list.
Im so disappointed with this app. I scheduled an Event and turned the reminder feature on. But it never alarmed me on the time I set. Uninstalling now.
"But can't really test this out since I'm tied with Habitica.  Oh yeah, I personally don't like the avatars though... It'd be nice if to upload your own avatar. Oh, just saw other people suggest the same lol."
"I had several recurring events to keep track of my week, but after the update, they disappeared."
"App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all.  Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually.  Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless."
Clean layout and does what it says without egregious permissions. Two thumbs. Unfortunately I can't find information about the app's functions even within the help menu: - Recurring tasks do not appear to reset if they are not complete. I can't figure out how to make them reset even if they are incomplete. - I can't make my recurring items show up on the calendar. - I can't manually set the reset time since my tasks might be completed between 8pm and 3 am. - View previous recurring tasks.
It's a great app but now a days it clears all the data and I cant see any tree which i plant earlier.... so i reinstalled all the time.. pls fix this prblm ( nb: i dnt have premium)
This is the perfect calendar app! And its gorgeous to boot!
Only 5 items on free version. Would be nice to have that clear so I don't have to waste my time and give out my email.
"I feel that there should be an option to keep track of a habit which we repeat multiple times in a day. Update: Thanks your quick response. I don't see a multiple repeat for the same day. If I want to track a habit 3 times a day, there is no option for that. There is an option only to repeat multiple times a week but not mutiple times a day."
"Hello Team, I bought the complete package in Feb 2015. However when I am trying to use HabitBull Premium + Extra, it says no account found in database. Can you please help me with this? Your support team is also not responding to the the ticket which i have raised earlier Support Ticket Opened [#388906]"
"This is a bad app. After purchasing a paid subscription, I got a lot of ads instead of an app that helps me plan my business.I hardly see the task scheduler, just advertising. A lot of advertising. The authors are too greedy."
It's the best to do list planner. Only thing I want from developer is to increase size of comments. Thank you for the efforts you put in making the app.
"Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird. Modal views when selecting a single task (WHY do I need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling??), no ability to choose multiple tasks (only by top menu - select tasks), strange icons.. That all makes me really sad. Rolled out to the previous friendly Todoist :("
Edit: Reverted to old version or something and issues are back :( Edit: Issue fixed and new update is great! Seems like you actually passed the issue along instead of making complaining subscriber have to repeat the complaint in email... Huge fan of Habitica. Used it for years. It was called HabitRPG when I started. Only to-do list app I have stuck to. Encourages you to build good habits in a fun way. Community-built. No ads...worth subscribing to support the app.
"Great app! I suggest a timer on this one, so we can still track our rest periods every time we take a short rest."
I really like this app so far. I've been using it a week now and it does everything I need it to do. I normally use the Astaire bullet journal method with a rolling weekly task list. But im still able to make a weekly task list and assign tasks to certain days. I can also migrate the ones that don't get done. I will certainly keep this app and don't mind the subscription because it works so well for me! I'll check back in again in a few weeks.
App not useful yet! Cannot arrange list by Outlook Category.
Good for shopping lists and To Do's!
This app is really helpfull but recently it is gettig crashed as soon as i click the app. I coudnt even open it. I have reinstalled this app for 3 times to make it work.
"I looked at a lot of habit tracking apps and this one was the closest I've found to what I was looking for. Unless I missed how/where to do them, there are three things I wish I could do in the app. First, create custom categories/subcategories, especially under health. Second, edit start dates without having to delete and retype to correct. Three, have the ability to add notes."
I actually love this and have use this for a year but the new update is no good at all that I need to edit my review due to the changes...
Good for a long time but recently it became unusable...it would always freeze up.
This app is CONSTANTLY dropping added data. I use it to remember all of my 'to-dos' and it drops 1/2 of them. Stuff I have deleted reappears. The app is NEVER in synch with the co-user of my lists. Terrible. I miss Wunderlist. I am in the process of finding a different app to manually transfer all of my data to. That process will be much less frustrating than trying to use this one.
"First read of this app in the book ""In-distract-able"" as I was struggling to focus my time working from home. It's such a basic tool for motivation but the simplicity is what makes it so great. Especially good for those who like the idea of growing virtual forests and having visual feedback to how productive you've been!"
"Very good. Simple and easy to use. I would like to see more statistics, because for now I can only see the statistics for only one habit at a time, but not a overall statistics."
Really like the app. However it is multiplying my tasks on a daily basis and i cant delete them as fast as they appear... frustraring not using it right now
Make a popup notification like t*ckt*ck app. And it will be awesome.
"I love this app. It's amazing and has made me a bit more productive with the few days I've had it. I just wish there was some sort of game that comes with it. I know it isn't the point of the app, but I feel like if some sort of game was added, there would be more incentive to do all your tasks. I know it's probably just me who has this issue, but a game really would add a lot to the app (even a tiny one)."
Great app! I use this all the time. Very customizable
Widget not working - this app is normally fantastic but lately my widgets are blank all the time. Very frustrating!
"I love this app! It makes my day to day so much more organized and pretty. It allows you to keep a check on your daily water intake, your to do lists, grocery lists, events, whatever you have in mind! I find that the layout of it all helps me to maintain productivity. I only wish there were a widget available!"
Best I could find for my needs
"This is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life. I've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks, but this may be a device issue, I'm not sure."
"On the widget, Calendar tab not functioning although inside the app already linked my Google calendar."
I paid $10 for the full feature set but this app crashes 10-20x per day. I just use it for the widgets and it still crashes over and over and over. Super annoying.
"I love this app! It's everything I needed, I use it to manage everything including taking my medications. Paying for premium was totally worth it especially since it's only a one time fee."
I love the idea but it's not working on my Samsung S10e. Like the main screen is just purple when I first open and then the features for designing my character didn't show any options. I'll happily try again once bugs are worked out. Keep us posted!
"I would love this app only if the notifications work at all. There were no alarms or notifications or pop ups showing in my Oppo F5. I tried tinkering with the system like what was said in the troubleshooting page so may times, yet nothing worked. Would give 5 if I do not have this issue."
How do I set a daily / weekly repeating task?
"Hey, guys! This is good idea! However, I have a feedback for you: Several times I accidentally was clicking task more than once, so I was increasing my level. I didn't found related settings. I think you should make task clickable (checkable, do you get me?) )only once per day, and highlight the finished tasks. This features will prevent accidental checking, therefore increasing level incorrectly. Could you explain me how to use such features, if you already have them??"
"I genuinely love this app. The widget for this app is my favorite! The widget is on one of my homescreen pages and it makes it so easy to read. I simply create a task and from the widget I can click the bubble to check it off the list. One of my lists is Family Planning and within that I can create tasks such as: taking a pill, setting doctor's appointments, keeping track of flows and much more. I also love that you can assort the lists by priority and colors."
"FYI, Adding more reminders is not free. You need to buy the premium version."
The one that I really needed. Tried too many Todo apps with Big O ( n to the power n ) complexity and on top of that you have to pay after certain time or step. This is constant time complexity and doesn't ask for any money. Now don't rant about my data. My to-dos are not very personal.
Bad
Great app with an ugly widget. If the widget was cleaner I'd give 5 stars.
It has almost everything that I need but the thing that frustrates me the most is the calendar view. That's really the most important thing to see how many days you've tracked in a row. Switch to calendar view it looks just like a regular calendar and nothing is highlighted for anything. You have to click on each individual day to see what it looks like.
This is a great app. I would definitely recommend this app. It helps to study and not get distracted because of your phone and this is something fun like it is an app for productivity but is like a game. Although there are some options with which we can get out of the app and use our phone but this app just makes me want to study and not cheat to use the phone. I love this app. This app does not even force you to rate it I am writing this long review for the first time. I definitely love it 😍
"while using the habbit feature, you can add multiple reminders for drinking water, but if you check done in any one of those reminders then it wont remind for the rest of the day. ruins the logic. Uninstalled Installed a year later and still the issue exists, the habit feature was a unique point which brought me to the app but I guess I'll have to use another one."
"I was so happy about this app. To my big disappointment, after I lost a lot of time to set my tasks and to prioritize, I had the very unpleasant experience to have all the tasks deleted, also the name of the list and no possibility to recover. I do NOT recommend it."
Very helpful when it comes to organizing
"Great motivator! Check those puppies off and they jump to the bottom of the list, with a nice green checkmark to boot! Using recurring daily habits(with numeric ""countdown"") rocks! Love this app!"
It's a great help with achieving your goals..
"I have peoples birthdays showing up in my phone, who i don't and have never known, nor have in my contacts"
"Could be better on Samsung S6, not showing reminders on screen, have to open the same as a diary...."
"Uhm there's a little bug that I encountered, I cannot disable the skill 
decay :< pls fix I'll give 5 stars"
I'm better with myself nowadays. Cheers
"Good but could be better. It works well and is very similar to Wunderlist, however it's very annoying that the reminders disappear from the notification bar if you haven't completed your task in a day. So you have to reschedule every day. Would be great if this could be fixed."
Provides you witha good experience of managing your every day time having routines is very helpful in this app
"I loved this app so much after I downloaded it and used it for about 2 weeks. Because I loved it so much I decided to purchase the pro full version and payed £4.99. However, it was not worth paying at all. I would have rather used the free version with the ads. I will recommend everyone to download the app and use the free version but dont get the £4.99 ad free version because it doesn't really give you anything extra. I would recommend the creator of the app to add more features for payed."
Awesome app. Helps me keep track of my daily tasks and routine. I like the fun reward and punishment system in the form of an rpg game. Keep up the good work!
The thing I have been searching for years... Finally found multiple things in a single app
The one thing I don't like is the alarm. Can't shut off without losing the event.
I like app very simple and comfortable to use I deleted but back to app could please also create web version of the app. gonna be cool.
Use to track work things
Syncing in the background between Android and Mac hasn't worked for months. Have to manually go into the Android app and do a sync. Doing a background sync on Android after every edit or notification that gets updated would be nice.
Great honestly great way to keep track of daily tasks to stay organized. One thing they should add is overall goals. And tasks leading to those goals.
"Navigation needs work: you can only navigate with the many buttons in the app, the back button closes the app. Feature request: Has weekly and monthly report, would like a daily report to share with an accountability partner Also, would be great to generate report based on category."
good not bad
"Works great except reordering shared projects always fails (my shopping project, my wife shares and she can never reorder on that project, but no problems on other projects)"
This is good app
Keeps me on top of things
Need to pay to track more than 5 habits and ui doesn't look simple or impressive
"App has been useful in helping me keep track of tasks and all, but lately the alarms I set on my dailies haven't been going off at all. Which is... unfortunate, because they're all to remind me to eat..."
I need more options of anything
Removing things on list isn't easy
"The best app of its kind, hands down. The only thing I would improve is the reminder system: right now the app would send you a notification to complete a habit/task even after you've already done it, when in my opinion it should automatically turn off. It's a minor thing, but it tends to get a bit silly when you've completed a lot of tasks ahead of schedule. Other than that, it's perfect."
App kept on crashing. I had to delete and download the app three times this week alone. I love the app. It has been very helpful. But this issue has been very annoying
"Since the last update, May 29, I have been losing random events. Tonight, I've added the same event four times over the last three hours. Just waiting to see if it disappears again. Several updates ago, the photos I attached to each profile stopped appearing. I think the OS was blamed. It's been a great app for several years but I'm afraid of what else I might lose in the near future."
"The new widget is terrible. Even in non-compact view, the elements are too small. And I can no longer access the main app window from the widget. This was possible earlier."
Couldn't figure out.
Feel like can add calender
Nice reminder app. Easy to use and categorise tasks 🙂👍🏼
"Does a good job, i like the widget"
"It does not work as it supposed to. I clicked the side button (button that pops up active apps), go to the home page from there, accessing other app, and the app still planting the tree even though I 'quit' the app"
"Impressive.Could be better if it had its inbuilt calendar which is linked with events of Google calendar .it should also have to do list with with alerts,a weekly planner.thia will make it perfect"
"Used it for 4 years, April they updated it and it's now a productivity killing app rather than a productivity booster app. Why? If you wanna rename your todo list you should be able to just click on the todoist and rename it right? WRONG, it opens a NEW WINDOW with sub taks!! I now have to click 2 times to rename the todo bullet. 2 times instead of 1.. Productivity or stupidity? I'm changing todo apps until they poll their users and understand that this is absolutely horrible.. Bye for now!"
Good improvements but still don't have nag or presisitent reminders. I missing a lot reminders accidentally
Very useful. Works well.
Loved wunderlist. This version doesn't always synch to my phone & there is no synch command. User friendly if you're only using it on one device.
Est ce que vous avez une version de Business Calendar pour les laptop ?
Very good app
"Poor widget options, which is what I needed most. Very space inefficient and not customizable at all. Disappointing. Todoist had the most compact and useful widget, followed by Microsoft ToDo."
This app helps you to achieve new goals good app 👌
"I love Habitica! I've used it for several years, both the browser version and the app. I love how simple it is and I love the social aspect! I've been able to make friends and find support through guilds, and my party really pushes each other to be our best and continually improve! This app has helped me focus on self care and get better grades in school. I'm building healthy habits and having fun with the creative quests and interactions! Habitica is amazing!"
I buy pro version but it features are not given to me
"As a user of GTasks (owned by TickTick), how do I FULLY synchronise my data with the cloud (preferably Google but will make do with the TickTick servers). I pay for this service but only 40% of my tasks are backed up on TickTick server/cloud. Any and all advice much appreciated. kind Regards John Collington"
This has been a great app to build habits. I would give it a 5 star but your limited to only 5 habits at a time. You can get more but theres a pay wall
LOVE THIS APP!! This app had saved me so many stressful headaches!! The creator is ALWAYS on top of it and so helpful with everyone's questions. Install this app - you won't be sorry!
"The widget was, finally, perfect. So of course someone had to make it less functional. Because obviously, a 3x2 widget tucked away in a corner of the home screen isn't a thing that a person should be allowed to have. No, clearly, only a widget that's required to take up MORE than half the screen will do. Is there seriously a good reason the widget can't be resized to something sensible any more? Because I can't think of one. And I am seriously frustrated."
"Awesome until.... I was trying this app out to see if it was possible to finally break ties with my paper calendar. This app had some features that made it better than Google calendars. That is, until you had to watch an ad to schedule an appointment. Now when I save an appointment have to sit through a full page ad. I didn't get enough time in the app to figure out if it was worth it to pay for the full version but now the mandatory ads are a deal breaker."
I miss an option for recurring tasks like do something every 3 days where if I check it a day later that automatically shifts all following tasks by one day.
"Okay But I wish it had options to increase exp and stays for example when you read a book gain x intuition when you run x times you gain x stamina, etc etc and get rewards and level that way. Gives more motivation for doing those things."
"Buggy interface. The grocery list feature is fine but the schedule is terrible. It kept changing event details after I saved. I had to go back in and turn off alarms for previously saved events (that I had alarms off). And it would NOT let me create an all day event that was only scheduled one day. No matter how many times I changed the dates it kept including the day before in my ""all day"" event. And then when I would try to edit it, it would change completely to two days before. What a mess."
It is good but not for me
Very useful
The app does not sync with my Google calendar and there is no sync option or refresh option. Meetings etc are not shown and I have to go back to the Google calendar or acalender to make sure I don't miss anything. Events made on my tablet do not show on my phone. Please fix this. It's such a great app if it just worked.
"after signing in, I get random notifications telling me things I absolutely do not care about. I haven't even added any tasks and it's already telling me to join groups and blah blah blah... no thank you."
Really weird formatting? I'm trying to be MORE organized not get a brain workout trying to figure out an app
Migrating from Wunderlist but to be honest with zero integration with google calendar as Wunderlist had...this does not work for me. Off to todoist which has full integration. Really don't understand why you would close Wunderlist before having the same features in ToDo...
"Its almost what i was looking for apart from is there a way to set how much xp is required to advance in level and how much xp completing a task will give you? E.g. i want to make it so i start at level 40 in benchpress and achieving 91kg will put me at level 41. I will reach level 100 in benchpress by the time i can do 150kg, completing 120kg would put me on level 70 etc.  Otherwise the numbers are just meaningless to me. Really i want to set it up so when i reach my goal in each thing i am at level 100."
"I'm not the kind of person who can stay loyal to an app regarding productivity for over a few days. But I've been using this app for over 2 months. And I love it! It's great to track habits. You can customize your habits and even add daily notes. Once you're on a streak, it feels harder and bad to break the streak. This is great!"
"This is a decent time managment app. The ability to create routines is handy, though it doesnt warn you or show if activities are overlapping. The most recent update (as of 3/30/2020) made the app look much cleaner, which is nice. I would like to see more personalization options t'wards the look af the tags and app. Choices now are very slim. The $5 price tag for the pro version doesn't feel worth it (yes, buyer's remorse), so if you can manage fine with the free version, stick with that."
"Deleted my account because I found something more aligned to my needs, but I still got charged for another year. Developer ignored my email and then denied a refund via PayPal so I've now paid $28 for something I can't and no longer want to use. Had no issues with the app itself but very disappointed with the customer service."
"Switched over from wunderlist. This app isn't as smooth to use and last night I put 2 things on my to do list with a reminder at 9:00am. At 10:00am I went into the app and that is when the reminders showed up in my notification bar. Previous reminders have also showed up with 2 hr delays, don't rely on this app solely for important reminders."
Nice
okayish
This app has even GREATER potential - better than most others. But development is slow and issues are not dealt with efficiently. At least some of the more critical items are more stable!
still testing
It is good but could be so much better with full Google Assistant integration...
Good as motivation to track and tick off daily goals.
"Great to-do list app with addicting premise, but can't remove glasses customization option once they're on. Please change this! I don't want my avatar to have glasses and can't remove them since the option doesn't appear to let me do so. Will change review to 5 stars once this is fixed"
"Mostly great, I just wish I could make my main to do list my home page."
"Maybe implement something that categorises and levels up specific areas, such as creativity, language, programming, DIY, home, gardening, hygiene, fitness, culinary skills etc. Everything seems to just bundle into general exp."
Well it is a good app but sometimes it just doesn't let me open the app so I am asking forest to please fix this problem other than that it is a pretty good app
I had a reminder set with a certain sound & it never went off
I really liked this until I realized that unfinished daily/repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day. That makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks I need to do each week.
"Suggestion, one if the things I liked most about Wunderlist was the ability to assign a task to someone straight from the list view instead of having to drill into the task. Please consider this UI update."
An ace planner app
"When i tried putting inmy class scheduel they kept vanishing when I add notes to a specific date. It might work fine if you don't need many events, but it's a pain if you have a lot to keep track of"
Im loving this app But sometimes it shows 'forest stopped working' please fix the issue😕
The app is great. I wanted to use this app as a way to help me to creat a better habit and staying on track with certain things. For me the notifications don't work unles I open the app and by that point its like my reminders have passed.. other then that easy app to use and navigate.
"Best planner out there! I love the ability to take notes, journal, track projects, schedule events and to-dos all in one place. Excellent!!!"
Love this app! Keeps me organized and productive. Only thing I'm bummed about is I can override the locking feature. Even sent an email about it.
Doesn't work sometimes.it goes blank
"(edit) Been using it for a while occasionally and every time it feels like a hassle to find what I need to reach within the app.. I only use the routines, no events or reminders, I have a separate app for that, Google Assistant wit a calendar. To add a change to one day it requires a lot of clicking to amend it.. I end up writing down the rest of the day tasks on paper, deleting, amending the times and adding them manually with the new times.. That's counterproductive. I need an easy way to move"
How to use this app? 🤔 Very bad experience. Please simplify the process. Nobody wants to take a extra tutorials to use your app to plan our day.
"I converted from Wunderlist to the Microsoft To Do and the transition has been quite easy. I really loved Wunderlist, but this app mirrors many of the functions, and particularly the ones I use most, for lists and list sharing. The performance has been consistent and easy to use. I'm very glad the Wunderlist/ now Microsoft team was able to model To Do as closely as possible to the excellent Wunderlist app, plus add some new features. I definitely recommend it. Thanks for all your hard work. PG"
"This is a great app for anybody needing some extra motivation or a way to organize their life. I've had some trouble editing or deleting reoccurring tasks, but this may be a device issue, I'm not sure."
After last update all info's gone. Shame on you. Android never more.
"Looks promising. Would like to see: routine sharing/sync (some routines you have to do with your wife), marking activity as done, have tags on timers and have more analytics on the actual timeline data (not routines).  I personally would pay a premium for these features."
Its good App
"Great and powerful app, except for one thing: location doesn't work when entering addresses. Whenever I type an address with house numbers, the location recommendation list never contains the house number..."
"a little confusing at first, but it transfers your calendar and alarms to the app. one bad part is it adds everything on your calendar. like if you add ""eat breakfast"" it'll go on your calendar. so that's only a little annoying since my calendar needs to be clear and easy to read. but besides that. it works well"
"Just had a big visual update but if anything the app is getting worse and worse. Now most of the time when I tap a plus sign to increase count of something, nothing happens. I have to drag down to refresh and then after it thinks for a minute it'll update the count. Or not, it kind of does what it wants at this point. I've mostly stopped using it because of this."
"I was excited to try this app, but like many others have said, the customization screen doesn't work. Let me know when it's fixed and I'll update and hopefully be able to start using it."
Almost every feature requires a premium account for 36€ per year... It's not even possible to test these features without subscribing to an annual plan
I've been using BC1 for years and I've installed BC2 on at least 2 seperate occasions. BC2 is so not as good as BC1. The overall look makes it look like a cheap childs game. The functionality became nonsensical and it made going back to BC1 such a pleasure. I can't imagine what the developers were thinking when making such changes. After using BC1 for so long I had high hopes for its future development but alas it not to be. These days I'm looking elsewhere.
way to confusing to do something simple
"I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for."
Very nice App.
I don't know why... Always I have problem with login to forest app!
A little too complicated and dictatorial (too many prompts). Plus only 5 habits allowed unless u buy the pro version! 7-10 habits and I may hv left it on my device and give it a proper run. Instead I decided to uninstall and download a simpler version which is more flexible and suitable to my needs.
critical
"I love this app! It makes my day to day so much more organized and pretty. It allows you to keep a check on your daily water intake, your to do lists, grocery lists, events, whatever you have in mind! I find that the layout of it all helps me to maintain productivity. I only wish there were a widget available!"
"A good app in general. I would love to be able to have ""loose"" tasks, for example: practice spanish twice a week. Which should be completed at least twice every week. Also, why not allow icons to be any emoji?"
"This app worked well for a year. Had ads, but I was fine with that. The latest update made the ads much bigger, appearing in the task sidebar instead of banners at the top and bottom. I was annoyed but tolerated it. Then today I got a full screen video add that I couldn't close until it was through. That's too much. Deleted. Reply to reply: I know I can pay to get them removed but I don't want to support a company that pushes an update with full screen video ads you can't close."
Overall the app is good but the notification sound doesn't seem to work after the session. I have tried setting all my phone notification settings as per the FAQ answers. But nothing seems to work. Hope you could help me fix this.
I like it. Getting use to it. Like the ease of use and the notifications!
I would give it a 5 but I recently got a new phone and I cannot sync at all. I really needed it to sync. Very disappointed because I followed all the steps in my email. Please help
It helps me keep track of my tasks very efficiently :)
"I really like the app because it helps me focus in studying and help me keep away from my phone, however, it keeps on crashing, I have already reinstalled for the fifth time now and I hope it won't crash again because I have already wasted a lot of plants and coins and I'm still not on premium so I can't retrieve them."
"1/5/20) I have tried the updates since my original post, and launch speed has slightly improved. Main Landing Page loads very slowly, but at least didn't crash right away again. Almost froze when scrolling through habits. I gave it more time to load, then tried going to a different section of the app & it crashed.. 11/9/19) Would be an awesome app, if it would load. Painfully slow startup and very laggy in app as a well. (Android 9 ; Moto G6 Play) Please fix! & I will actually update my review."
its really helps me a lot......easy to use and works a lot.......
The app was amazing but lately it's been crashing a lot and i had to uninstall and reinstall it and yet it keeps in crashing i lost my data and it's frustrating
I love lists and this is the app I have been looking for. It helps me stay organised and on top of all the things I need to do. I really like that I can create multiple lists and that there is a widget so I can easily access my tasks and tick them off as I go. So many great features in a really user friendly and visually pleasing app - so many colour options made me extremely happy!
"Very nice app,really useful but App keeps crashing please fix this"
"The perfect marriage of pen & pixel. If you love the features and visuals of a paper planner but stink at keeping up with it, this is for you. It allows me to: -sync to my Google calendars, & color code -switch an event from one Google calendar to another which even Google calendar won't let me do -look at my schedule as a single day, week, or month without having to put items in 3 different places -set and write down goals -track water & meal plan -make lists -check off tasks"
Romantic
"Cant even get past the first screen. I get a notice that my phone is blocking the app, but there are no instructions in the troubleshooting for my pixel, I've looked all over my settings, there's nothing I can find to change to ""allow"" this app to do something. Frankly I'm dubious that this app somehow needs some extreme level of permissions that no other ever has, especially as it hasnt told me why."
Use it constantly to keep family schedule in sync. Can't live without it!
Was a great app...but could not login..since last month so...bye bye planner pro
I love the concept of the app I'm just not digging the functionality. Trying to set a custom date and time is a complete pain in the you know what. Every time I select pm it's stays at am. I have to do it multiple times before it catches. Same issue with the clock. I try to rotate the dial to select an hour and it hangs and throws me over to minutes. I go back to hours and it does the same thing. I finally just gave up. Back to the old string around the finger. ☹️
Will update down the road
Too complex as a game! The time I spent tried to understanding how it work could have been spent actually working!
"meh I left the ""meh"" on 2/2019. Today is 3/2020. While the calendar is ok, the ""themes"" never change and, really, are not anything of interest. They really need to be completely changed. Also, color coding helps me keep track of a lot of things I have going on...the measley 7 or 8 colors they have are TOO FEW & what?! No pink?? (A nice hot pink so it will stand out). I mean, idk, I'm still just meh... 😕"
Installed it and it glitched and didn't display many of the images on the 'create your avatar' page. Immediately Uninstalled.
"You're good guys. Your efforts are admirable Please consider making the app 
available to milions of people and support ""rtl""."
It's 👍
Not upto the mark but its okay. Ads give ptoblem and ui is little weak.
Hi have been looking for a app which remind me each and every hour because I'm a student and I need a that kind of app but in your application this feature is not available... 😒😒😔
"For anyone who wants to manually order your list, just long press the task and drag/drop it. It's really easy. My 3 out of 5 is because the widget seems broken. I have a large 3 x 3 widget to see my Planned tasks. The list randomly disappears in the widget. Open the app and it's still there. Go to the widget it's still missing. Randomly it comes back. If this gets fixed, it'll be 5 of 5. Months later and the widget still randomly stops working. Please fix it."
Major issues need all email so I can send you pics pixel 2xl
"This app is amazing it has (mostly) all the nessary tools.Though to make this even better you can include a timer. An include it on your wallpaper , otherwise it is a really good app for everyone"
Itssa ok
Does what it's meant to. Limited to the amount of list you can make unless you pay for premium
"In general this app works great, but since it switched from Wunderlist to Todo, it now logs out frequently and then the widget will no longer show your lists until you open the whole app again. It happens every few days and across multiple phones. Please fix this"
"Garbage. The one time I can't remember if i checked the notification for taking my medication or not, there was no way to go and see which days I checked it or not. What's the point of that?"
"App is extremely useful just that the ""search"" feature doesn't cover all the notes in the app"
"I needed a replacement for Wunderlist, which we relied on for task lists for our business & employees. With TickTick, I had to manually type in each task for each list because the Import feature only put them in my Inbox. There's no Home Screen - hitting the return arrow exits the app (not a biggie, just an adjustment). The real downer is having to pay to share the lists with more than one person. Collaboration was an important feature we needed. Using Microsoft's To Do for now."
"It could make some more features available for free versions,so it would be the better."
"Excellent app with few feature limitation in free versions which are available on similar apps such as comment, reminder etc are locked on free edition"
"It's a good app. It fuses the entertainment received in playing games with finishing chores, which is pretty hard to pull off. I'll recommend it to anybody who's trying a lot to change their life but easily succumbs to their desires."
Due Date is wonky. I made a few items on my list and the due will not change from the current day. The due date worked on other items. I don't need another app to work around.
Most unique app I've ever used. So far so good. Fun. Makes me want to earn coins by completing goals and tasks so I can buy some fancy stuff or a pet.
"Simple yet attractive, minimalist app for you to build your focus. Do give this one a try."
"I like the new ""Jump Day"", and ""Insert Gap"" options, and the Advice/Delay dialog for multiple activities. The Undo feature is a great addition as well. I'm really disappointed with the new look and that vertical scrolling through. Makes it so much harder to use - it's easier to start changing the wrong day since the current activity is not highlighted in any way, and starting time is not that clear as before. Also, those activity/free time blocks take too much space, yet there is not enough space horizontally for the text and a lot of the additional tags aren't visible. I'd prefer a more compact look. It would take a lot of time getting used to this..."
This is wonderful but I really need to be able to use it offline as well
Great
"We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity."
"I was going to give 4 stars, but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to Google play if you said five stars, so I lowered it to 2 stars."
It is all for me about habits i wasn't able to work on it but in this one it is so helpful just i have one issue i don't know if didn't find it or it is not at the program that if u need to remind your self more than one time in the day i just remind my self once a day i don't know if it in the app or not
"Make some more widgets, rest all app is nice and user-friendly"
Why the 'deep focus mode'? It defeats the purpose of the app now. Enabling it requires permissions that a user would not be comfortable sharing! And I even paid for the app recently. Disappointed.
"time zone doesn't work, i have my phone in a different time zone than i live in and have managed to change most things to my home time zone. this app allows me to change my time zone but it doesn't actually reflect the change anywhere. the date and time of the app and events stay incorrect. my phone is on Taiwan time for now and i have set the app, the preset for events and every individual event to mst, but when i open the app or use the widget, the dates show in Taiwan time still"
There should have deep vibration mode after completion of 25 min...initial version had that setting...I am unable to notice the completion of task as it vibrate for a moment only..plz rectify it...Otherwise this is an excellent app!!
It only works when linked to another calendar app....and it's difficult to change the time from am to pm.....
"App idea and design is great, but it is not possible to add calendar from Work Profile account anyhow - it is just invisible. Android 7.1.1.   Promise rating 5, if fixed.  Upd: thanks for prompt reply, but it is about Google Calendar in Work Profile - it creates a separate copies of Google Apps for it. Please have a look at work profile specifics for Android 7+"
This app has helped me to organize my daily task.
I luv it
"After getting the premium subscription I found that, Windows 10 app doesn't have any app lock mechanism. So anyone using the machine has access to Todoist! I'd request you to fix these kind of basic things before bringing more features."
"I've spent hours on it already and I'm just not getting it. Looks like most tutorials are for an older version. Can't figure out how to create shorter than 7 day Routines, what's the difference between a Routine and an Event, etc."
"It does not remind with a pop up notification continuously for consecutive days even when the dates are saved and the notifications are not on the home screen and therefore often missed. Moreover, it does not remind about the task the whole day even when no particular notification time is noted. This App. is not dependable."
I would normally give this 5 stars but the past few days the widget has not allowed me to make tasks on future dates. It just puts the task on todays date. And you cant put tasks on random future days either. Tomorrow yes but i like to plan ahead of tomorrow
"Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for...."
"Great way to organise my day and plan my time! Thank you, I tried Google tasks before but it didn't help much. With love. But what the app lacks is the way to sort and align the tasks in correct order."
This app certainly has some really great features which others competitiors don't. Clearly have potential to be the best in the market. Cons - Sync issues Time to load up in windows 10 Bugs in habit tracker & tasks.
Good
This is exactly what I needed and it's so easy to use. You can repeat and clone schedules and it doesn't take too much time to do it. I love it and I'm sad I didn't find it earlier 😭
"Inferior to wunderlist in every way. Sync works poorly, planned smart list doesn't group by day which is very frustrating, search function is poor."
"Just paid for this app. Latest update, I've lost some events in 1 of the 4 Google calendars I view. Those events show up just fine in the Google Calendar, and used to show up o.k. My free Business Calendar. I see you did an update July 20. Maybe there is a bug in that version. I tried stopping the app, cleared cache, cleared all data, started over. Still missing some events in one calendar. Refresh/resync doesn't help. All events showing in Google Calendar. Shut down, restarted phone, not fixed."
"wint really allow you to use it or even save tasks, (which disappear). you just get bombarded with limitations and STOP SlGNS if you try to use features while having ""upgrade to ""premium"" ads"" shoved down your throat. I don't even know if this app works or not...that's how "" limited "" it is."
"Ok concept, but just takes way too much effort to make the core concept even work on a basic level. Kind of feels like this kind of an app needs some sort of AI with suggestions for every parameter, and sync between different devices, to get the basic functionality into usable state."
Useful easy to use and fulfil my needs But i still didn't experience it's use in sharing or groups
"I couldn't register , the circle rounds and rounds .. And nothing happens"
Constant prompts for trials and upgrades. Super annoying.
"I have used this tool continuously since 2015 and it's a fun way to get yourself to do tasks that otherwise you might not be motivated to do. I've been a subscriber for almost two years. I would highly recommend Habitica, whether you prefer to do it all on your own, quest with others, take up challenges, or just keep track of your flossing. There's a lot to out and I've never gotten bored in almost five years."
"I loved the app and purchased it to help my son keep up with studying. I paid for the premium account which indicates you can log in on multiple devices both iOS and Android. After setting it up on my phone, which was easy but took some time,when I tried logging onto my son's phone it didn't recognize the account. I contacted customer service but didn't hear back. It's a nice app, really like the features, so this was really disappointing. I could set it up again on his phone but without me being able to monitor on my phone it's not helpful. I still hope someone can help me fix this or I should get a refund for my purchase."
Just like wunderlist except worse !! Laggy update of list from one device to any.
"Why do you get rid of things after making users use to it?? What happened to the press and hold to multi select? Why can't I type 'tomorrow' and click backspace to remove the auto calendar add like I was able to before the update. Thanks for the new features but don't take out the old ones, or at least add an option in the settings to keep things the same"
Didn't really get a chance to test it...but it forced me to do a review to uninstall.
"Since lasted actualizations the app don't work correctly, can't activate deep focus mode because my phone (xiaomi redmi go) hasn't available notification access option"
"Seems to have glitched out on me. When I put in my username and display name, it gave me an error saying ""Path Profile.Name Required."" Then none of the Avatar customization options appeared. I wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed. Reopening the app took me to the Dailies tutorial and now I'm sure I'm missing something. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10."
Really good app. Takes a little fiddling to work out how to get it set up just right. I like having it as a widget on my home screen so I can see tasks. Would be nice to be able to tick off tasks from the home screen widget without needing to open the app entirely but I am being pedantic. Edit: thank you! My phone obviously didn't accept it last time I checked. Changed to 5* :)
Good it's help me for focus
"Really a fun and somewhat complex habit tracker to have. Recommendation : you could include some fantasy quests and creatures and some kind of algorithm that uses the skills I made to be used in finishing the quests and fighting creatures, maybe like dice roll mechanics. Would be fun to see your skill in use, cos just building them up isn't enough. Good job, add this quest system and its a complete app. Also app generated loot too..."
Its really good but is there a way to see my focus time in hours and not minutes
"The app is simple & clean. Tracks Habits efficiently. The only reason I am giving 4 star is because Reminder notifications aren't working properly. Habit Tracker, please fix it!"
"Helps me stay focused on doing what I need to do. The more I use it, the more I learn how to maximize its effectiveness, especially by accessing features I previously ignored."
"Multiclick spam to ""encourage"" upgrading to pro version."
"I have thoroughly enjoyed my AA ever since I found out about last year! I had been looking for an organizer that I use as a calendar and to handle my many ""things to do"" lists. Thank you Katy for your vision and concept."
Not sure...bought the premium subscription for a year...not sure though. Help pages are pretty good so I will keep working with this. I like that it crosses my devices.
"I loved this app, but I have been a premium member for months, but today right after Google play sent me a receipt for June, the app tells me I need to upgrade to premium. What gives, Tick tick? I'll be happy to change my rating if you can restore my premium membership. Update: got an answer on Twitter sort of: had to figure out myself where restore purchase was, but once I clicked it, I was premium again!"
"Exactly what I needed, feels fancy like a paper planner but syncs perfectly with online calendars!"
This app doesn't remind to complete the tasks no matter what you do. I missed an important activity because of this app which caused me considerable financial loss. Please stick to Any.do!
Really useful app for planning your day.
Great productivity app to stay organized
I'm still trying it out but so far it has helped a lot. One would not waste time if they have this app in hand.
Best habit app to date! Has every feature were other apps only have limited features. The only habit app you'll ever need.
"I had to buy this app because I need that larger widget to fit my needs, and you cannot test it out with the free version. Sadly, it's too buggy to be of any use, at least on the AIO Launcher. Still overall better than my last habits tracker, but I feel ripped off."
"I think the app I great! I just have the basic free version, but it has everything I need."
I love the app but I'm probably going to have to uninstall it. Its had a problem lately where the notification will not go off. No matter how many times I push close or silence the sound keeps playing. It's becoming annoying.
This app is so good for focus on your study .👍
"This application is good in a way that you can prioritize and organize your tasks. The thing is that, the important features such as the 'alarm' for notification of reminders and sharing of documents are only allowed in premium package and as a student I would not be able to avail these features monthly.  I wish that you can add a feature wherein you can personalize your notes so it will be more fun and exciting to use."
I love the concept of the app I'm just not digging the functionality. Trying to set a custom date and time is a complete pain in the you know what. Every time I select pm it's stays at am. I have to do it multiple times before it catches. Same issue with the clock. I try to rotate the dial to select an hour and it hangs and throws me over to minutes. I go back to hours and it does the same thing. I finally just gave up. Back to the old string around the finger. ☹️
Easy to use but needs better or customizable colors
I'm facing a problem that is reminders are not working properly (device Lenovo k3 note Android 6.0
why doesn't adjusting habit streak reflect in health and experience (say if i accidentally clicked + or - for a habit)?
"Alarms or notifications don't work unless you open the app, then it floods all the notifications for the tasks as i open the app. Defeats the purpose of the app. Tedious round-about way to delete a Habit compared to deleting a Task. Not sure how this app got a 4.6 rating."
"Please put a feature where I can count my productive time like a cronometer. The main idea of the app is super useful to avoid distractions, but I also love the idea I can track my real progress on a task. I would love to see it in my little forest/garden with the other trees and bushes I plant. This app is so useful and lovely I bought the ""pro"" version. Please think about it, it would be so so so nice of you. I use a special app for it, but I really wish it was in Forest."
"I like this app, finding it very helpful with day to day tasks!"
"Seems broken - cant complete the process of creating new tasks, so I'm just stuck with a huge empty menu I cant change. Loved the idea but this is broken and unusable."
Exceptional and meticulously developed app!! Has all the necessary features and I am saying it after trying almost every good organiser app on Playstore. Kudos to the developers and Microsoft.
I see no difference in this and Google calendar
"You should put in the description that the widgets, monthly, weekly, and even daily calanders are for premium users, that's the main reason why I downloaded. If you don't have the money for a subscription its just a checklist, which can be done on most defualt phone calander apps."
"Despite working fine with the web version of the app, this Android version of Ticktick throws a validation error on my email address when I try to sign in because (according to Carol, a ""dev"" of the Ticktick team with whom I spoke about this on their help forum) my email address features hyphens. Tf?! Since when are hyphens in address so uncommon that they're not worth supporting. Terrible, imo, UX (both in app and for customer service)."
great app. love it
The event didnt sync to my other device
has good features although takes a very long time to figure out how the lists work.
Please can you integrate with Outlook calendar
The task add bar blocks the list if it's too long with no way to scroll down. Also would like an option to have completed tasks to disappear not just sit there crossed out taking up space. And make it easier to share lists with others. Should be able to accept invites in app not over email.
This is better if it has calendar to help decide and organize planning and time managing
"Under subtitle *security* ""However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers"" Sorry no thanks.i just downloaded but after reading privacy policy i prefer going thru •Google official •one & app like calendar required lot of access ,&i personally don't wanna bleach my data like this..btw the tq for placing the info it to let us know :)"
"It's working, but the ads are getting really annoying."
"I love this app, but my premium service doesn't seem to follow me. I sent multiple emails to get it resolved however I'm only getting autogenerated response emails."
"So far seems okay. Different trees are about 2000 coins to unlock, which seems excessive and like it is going to take me forever to save up for. I'm only using the free version though."
"I don't know why they changed it, but I hate the fact that you can't type in the time anymore. You have to scroll, like you're on Wheel of Fortune or something. That is the biggest pain in the behind ever invented!!! I don't mind it if there's a option, but this doesn't appear to give you a choice anymore. Please change it back."
Please improve the persistent notification. When I close the app it get removed it should be there for all time.
wew
"I'm really enjoy your app, but where is subfolders? This is very useful feature, especially for GTD method. Launch this feature please and I'll change my rate at 10 stars 🌟"
"Do not use this app, lost all my data (something like 3 years) go ahead and read other have the same problems, I even have premium. Now its impossible to login back with FB or email. Really, really disapointed. Developers dont answer any emails."
Looks good. But doesn't have web version. Would be 5 stars if I was rating author's dedication. Functionality wise can't give more than 3. The app is inferior to Any.do or microsofts todo
"Tried this app for a bit. The logic is very different from what I need, so the experience wasn't good. This app focuses on routines and is built around this concept. It was very confusing at first (because it started with abstract ideas, not what average joe is already familiar with; e.g. calendar/timeline) and the entire experience just felt awkward. For me, all I want is, see the day/week/month, add to-do items one by one, and be able to turn any of these items into routines when I want to."
Great app for the most part. Would be nice if each project a person could list goals till completion as well as being able to have a separate tasks list. One for home versus one for work.
"read a negative review which had a reply to someone calling out the subscription, they said all ""major"" features are available for free. No, no they aren't you can't access the calendar at all it's an entire tab on the bottom of the app it's pretty ""major"" in my book"
"Decent enough GTD app, but i only started using it after reading it will be integrated with Google Assistant soon. Seems like they've been touting this integration for months, with no real action or even updates on when we can expect this! Disappointing."
Totally useless - sharing lists does not work.
"I cannot givey opinion, because I cant install the app."
"There are bugs that break the immersion for me. It's not as responsive as it looks, and the design should be worked out in the app. To complete a challenge, I need to post my goal on the chat, fine. But then I cannot access the chat room through the app, and I need to use the browser for that. Please improve the user xp."
"Best free calendar app I've used, syncs with Google and outlook calendars...... ....Edited from 5 to 2 stars...the video ads are too painful. I've already read the default reply to the other reviews complaining about this. I know the fee is low and one time...I promised myself I'd get the paid versions of all the free software I use once I'm not on student income. But I'm not rewarding this painful ad practice by going paid. I will pay for a different calendar."
when adding a task it transferring you to Google calendar then after adding the event it doesn't appear on the widget?
It is a practical app and easy to use.
Not flexible enough for my needs
Does not sync with google
"my review used to be 5-star, and I wrote a whole darn paragraph about how amazing forest was. it still is ! however, whenever I enter the app, the app immediately kicks me out !! please fix this, I've tried reporting a problem but it's been days and I haven't gotten back from anyone and the problem is still not fixed !! I would really love to give forest 5-stars again so please fix this, I love forest :"") update: tried uninstalling and installing the app, still no change !! :(("
Its okay so far but im not sure on how to find the focusing tree part in order for me to stay focused just wondering how you do it other than that not too bad of an app
"i just downloaded it and used it once (set timer 2 hours). after the timer finished, the app wont open several times until it told me to erase all app data :( my treeeeeeeeee 🥺😭 so yeah, not good app but it kinda cute"
Good
Why not find Arabic language
"I miss Wunderlist. It was a near perfect app. To Do, on the other hand, is buggy as heck. The widget almost never works. Lists aren't always backed up properly. I wish Microsoft would have just left Wunderlist alone."
where my reply ended up i cant see but i am a user for 2.5 years and this app never worked properly for me. i use for the script task adding feature and pay for supporting its development but they are not much interested i guess. businessline.halit.... try searching your emails. i wrote more details in original post.
It's a great app especially for entrepreneurs who have too many scheduled meetings in a day or for students who get a lot of homework or have to do a lot of studies in a day
I'm struggling with this app. I'm trying so hard to like it but there are basic things that I want it to do that it doesn't seem to be able to do. 1: It doesn't seem to be able to set a reminder for a whole list to alert me during any particular day. Instead I seem to have to set an alarm for each task which means that I would have alarms going off all day. That would drive me insane! 2: It isn't possible to contact the developer through the app. Quite bizarre!
So far nothing bad or excellent to say. Just a neutrally good app to use
"Very good working app. But after knew update every time I open the app it vibrates for clearing off checked todos exactly 12, even though I didn't shake my phone."
"Great, robust & easy to use"
reminder doesn't work
Synch across devices is currently broken
Do not have option to not connect to fb google or email
Easy to use interface and very helpful. Just wish it had a pin up on the home screen so I could directly look at my list
Need be online every time start
alarms and notifications don't work which is crucial to an organiser
This app looks to carry the torch from the now abandoned LifeRPG app and from a bit of digging so far I'm impressed. Some things are tucked behind a pay wall such as the calendar and aesthetic additions like themes and icons but it's a relatively low price and helps support the devs so I'll probably bite on that once I've set up everything and used the app a bit. One suggestion I'd have is to implement geotagged triggers for events - like bringing up a reminder when I'm near the gym or store.
"Love this app The thing that I loved the most about this app that shows the word ""GIVE UP"" instead of ""CANCEL"" or any other arbitrary word , which makes you feel guilty when you intend to turn off the timer."
"A really good app but since the new update the interface look so bad, was so much cuter and clean before now it's weird"
Very helpful to remember repeating tasks
"suddenly with ads and paid content disappeared, synchronization has some issues"
Completely unusable on Android right now. Everything is blank or not loading. Downloaded and deleted right away which is unfortunate because it looked like something I'd be really interested in.
"Enhance productivity, but push a lot for premium"
"why weekend just 2 days on sat sun, but my weekend is on friday only."
The app is great but after using awhile it start to lag.
needed a standalone platform which does not connect to any of my calendars.
Im giving it 3 stars. it deserves 5 stars for the app but getting 3 cause after i bought some Gems there were some shady withdrawals which means the privacy protection for my card was breached... and im 99% sure its from Habitica cause this happened right after the purchase. please increase your cyber security for card transactions.
"A perfect app to prioritize daily tasks, yet the U.I is still not up to mark."
"App has a lot of features, unfortunatelly many not free of charge"
"it's really unresponsive. I have to tap 3 times so something opens or to check a box or anything..  too bad, I really liked it but this is too annoying."
"Customizable views, includes tasks, and easy to key on off multiple read only calendars. The best way to negotiate multiple scheduled. update 2020 : still great and best customizable calendar display"
It was ok before. Now it changes the stuff that I enter. Please fix.
Autofill on Android 10 does not work
Waste of time. Unhelpful and unmotivating.
why you changed layout to old one..its really bad and annoying.
I like the app but the fact that there are lots of other apps that can do the same thing ... it's imo ridiculous to charge a monthly fee.. they justify it by saying it's a service blabla it's an to do app. More people would actually pay for it if it wouldn't be a subscription model.
"Okay app, but it needs ""Do not disturb"" mode to be perfect."
Needs work. Time options in Custom ARE NOT Professional enough.
"When I try to set up avatar - photo on OnePlus 6 , I have black screen."
"Everything is good. My only issue is that it doesn't send the message to you the exact moment you assigned it. Eg. I set a reminder at 8pm. The BOT only WhatsApped me 15mins later. Other than this, everything else is good. Love the feature of a WhatsApp reminder BOT. Improve on this area and you'll earn 1 more loyal customer"
"very simple app to track your progress towards acquiring a habit, the only downside is that you can't sync the app as it says ""no internet connection"" when there absolutely is. Also, together with this bug all forums are no longer available as well as daily quotes, it's just gone. Previous rating was 5 stars, but with this bug continuing for half a year now I can only give 2 stars."
Very handy tool.
"Smooth transition from Wunderlist. Most of the features are the same, but I do find ToDo more easily integrated into my daily use. I can add and edit tasks from the widget (wunderlist only allowed my to view, and would open the app if I wanted to check off a task). I find the My Day feature, and the option to add tasks from items scheduled for that day or previous days a cleaner, more uncluttered user experience."
"Really nice app, the older version with the display on the lock screen showing countdown was useful.. please bring that back."
"Clean, customizable, widgets, intuitive, and NO Ads. Perfect."
"This app doesnt require your firstborn in order to function as similar apps do. The Quick post function is great. However, unlike other similar apps, this doesnt have a widget feature to show what the upcoming daily task is on the screen. So for me, that is really unfortunate. If this changes, I will gladly give this a perfect rating."
NOBODY USE THIS APP. Read all the forums. The app does not support the sync once you've bought premium. Everyone's saying the same. And the devs DO NOT RESPOND TO HELP REQUESTS. I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.
"I like this app and what it can do and am pleased with its functionality. However, having paid for the premium version, I find it annoying beyond belief that I get pop-ups every 2 weeks asking me to leave a review. So, developers, I've left one but you've lost 1.5 stars for spamming me with these requests. This shouldn't happen in a paid app without any opportunity to turn off these notifications."
"DO NOT PURCHASE! The app works as it's supposed to, with exception for the added purchase features. I bought the app so it could sync up with multiple devices, that feature does not work despite following the FAQ as to why it might not work. I have tried their support ticket system which had an automated response, but they have yet to respond despite me trying multiple times to reach them and ask for assistance or a refund."
"It could be absolutely great... Except my widget is blank when it shouldn't be and my notifications don't work. However, I love this app and think a lot of hard work went into it"
"doesn't work anymore, I can not go to the store to purchase different tree species anymore, forest stops responding and I'm back on my home screen. I can't have any sounds and the coins I earn disappear ): I don't like it anymore. it's pointless, but these glitches have actually made me more desciplined, and I don't use my phone even without the fear of the plant dying. the app sucks and I can't care more about reaching out to the developers /:"
"It was great before, but lately it sends notifications whenever it likes. It doesn't notify according to schedule anymore. And now, it doesn't notify at all."
A really awsm app to make and maintain a schedule. It really helps a lot in time management.
Amazing app
Great and useful reminder app but it has many feature for which we have to buy its premium version. Previously I gave it wrong rating by mistake i giving rating of another apps and by mistake i gave it the rating of another reminder app
Helps me to organize my day when I don't have my physical planner at hand held me to remember important and vidal tasks that help sort out my family and daily routines while allowing to add onto my busy schedules throughout the week also able to sort out the important tasks by colour coordination . Thank you for the opportunity to have a great planner at my 👆 fingertips
"Something is wrong with the last version. Since I updated, I can't login. I use the right email & pass, and it keeps loading ""getting things ready"". I tried to delete and install again. Same problem. All of my stuff is there, and it's very annoying. I really like Any do and use it for years! I hope that you'll fix it soon cause i really don't want to leave to another app"
A lot of bugs for an app that tells you to pay to support its development.
Thanks for this perfect app. How I can use coins? How I can buy with coins??
Best to-do app on the market.
"I installed and then uninstalled it. Unless I am mistaken, there is no way to edit day-by-day deviations from a routine. So I can set up a routine, but then have no way to track how well I followed it, day by day (for instance, exercised for half an hour instead of an hour, or started late, or missed it completely, or did things out of order). Am I missing something?"
"So far, its working for me. I needed something that could ring or vibrate."
Juat started using this and although it seems to do most of what i need i think it has some basic things missing.
"Incredible!! Intuitive, simple, fluid, and has everything you need for organisation in one place ! Before downloading I had been using multiple apps to track my projects, habits, and events, and now i can do everything in one app it's amazing ! The pomo feature is also a great bonus :) An overall very enjoyable app, the widgets are soooooooo good, and the premium subscription is very reasonably priced and definitely worth it ! I recommend 100%."
Very helpful app... I used to follow the 25 - 5 rule by using the timer in my phone... But it was time consuming and very very boring... Happy I found this app at the right time....😄😄 Can you please add a thing to the app? When I use deep focus mode I would need a app to run to study.... So give permission for one app to run even in deep focus mode please.... I would love it to be added...😄
Its very useful
"Cool app, seems to have all I need at this point. My only 2c would be that 
the widget weekly view should have the option to see the 7 days ahead 
rather than the current week; if it's a Friday, I don't really care what I 
did on Monday, I wanna know what's happening next Monday"
"This is pretty great but has what I think is a major bug. In the settings you can choose a default for reminders. So, I choose ""an hour before"". That means, to me, that if I say something is at 2pm, it will remind me at 1pm. However, instead, TickTick sets the task for 3pm and the reminder for 2pm. This is, obviously, wrong. Fix that and its 5 stars but as it stands, I now have to set each reminder individually, which is a pain."
"Useful and very nice apps, I bought premium, 5 stars when can backup with gdrive😁"
"Dear support! It is a pity that Microsoft is closing Wunderlist, because that app is very simple to use and very fast. Unfortunately your to do app is slower, there is not done job with hashtags. Tasks need to be selected before moving. In Wunderlist everything is much simpler and faster. Guys please take good features from there. It is big pain to lose Wunderlist. At least upgrade your app normally. Thank you."
It is useful but very user friendly
"I regret buying the premium version, a lot of money for only a minor update. I wish I could get a refund. Do not buy the premium version from the app, it doesn't worth your money"
I can no longer touch the widget to open the full app. What happened? I use to be able to touch the upper left hand corner of the widget and the list would open in full screen.
This app is great but i have some problems with it. I'm currently using android 4.4.4 and the deep focus mode is not working at all. I have another phone with android 9 and focus mode is working just fine. Is there any way you can fix this? Thanks!
"This app is an excellent idea, if only it worked. I have been unable to move off the home screen without it crashing. Its a shame as it has a lot of potential."
Needs fixes... Like the repetition is screwed also the generate habit... Looks like the developers don't use it themselves.
I've tried many calendar apps and this is my favorite. I've been using the pro version for many years as several devices.
"app has kept organization relatively simple the past several weeks.. i have no prob giving this 5☆, except having issue on my tablet viewing monthly calendar (off-center).. i find myself going back & forth btwn tablet & phone.. if this is a settings issue that can be resolved, pls advise.. overall, i think the app could help many out there.."
All basic features are paid and the free features are very limited...Very disappointing..
Very nice app 👌 I love it...
"It does not work as it supposed to. I clicked the side button (button that pops up active apps), go to the home page from there, accessing other app, and the app still planting the tree even though I 'quit' the app"
Recently a ridiculous amount of advertising has been added to this app & I'm unable to add appointments while I wait for the ad that covers the whole screen to finish. I can no longer use this as its affecting my business. It has been a good calendar for years but i will be deleting it asap. Update - the developer responded & said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs... THIS IS INCORRECT. An ad appears after every diary entry + other times too. I enter multiple entries every day so get many ads.
Easy to handle.
"Pro user here: I have 2 issues 1. After I clear/kill the app (swipe away in the multi-task mode) the Forest app ceases to work and I can use any other app. Please fix this. (Pixel 2 user) 2. Why can't Pro-users watch an Ad to double their coins? We should have the liberty to avail this feature too. I used to double my coins (by watching 30 second ads) before I paid for the app, and now I can't do it anymore. That's not fair."
I can't scroll the widget or other screens. I'll probably subscribe if this gets reliably fixed since Wunderlist is dead now.
This is not an rpg!?!?!?! This is a goal tracker with an avatar. Ffs. So Useless.
"Have been using it for a week only and will most likely go premium! I love it. But a few needed suggestions. An option to make a task recurring. And also maybe on one same habit, have different times per day: weekday /weekend. And I can't seem to edit which days for habits after the initial setup. I also would like the completed button to be a little bit harder do. Maybe a swipe would be nicer."
Ok so it's not bad but for me it was a little bit hard to work. But don't get me wrong there are probably loads of people that do understand it. It was just a little hard for me. :)
Thought the UI was clunky and unintuitive. I bought their premium based on an MKBHD video -- I will be cancelling today.
Premium version only
"Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?! Furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and I had full access, there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much. Also what's the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want? And a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time, and it's not fun enough."
I have been using it since 2018 and am currently a paying subscriber but I wouldn't recommend it to others. Notifications do not pop up on my note 10 plus. WhatsApp notifications also did not appear for 2 straight days. I won't be renewing unless they get their act together
Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.
"Now down to 1 star for the unappreciated bilingual holiday settings for BC Canada. Absolutely no need for this. The phone and app setting where the language is set to ""English"" should override any other situation. I didn't get a satisfactory answer from the dev. I'll keep deducting stars as long as the app doesn't improve. Update July '20: over 543 different apps and the only 1 ramming French down my phone is BC2! My 1 star won't change until you do. No change!!!"
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great
It is easy to follow and I love the reminders! It is super helpful for me!
"You've had all this time since you started ""fresh"" when you couldn't make Wunderlist do what you want and you still have syncing issues. Write some goddamn integration tests. Syncing should be the most basic functionality that you focus on since without it the app is actually useless."
"I like the concept of the app and the fun gamification of reaching your goals however it is SUPER buggy on Android. The app is constantly quitting unexpectedly, not closing tasks properly and not doing rewards properly. I've reported it multiple times now and there has never been any update to fix it. I recommend going with another app if you have an Android device to save yourself the frustration."
"Loads of bugs, can't even register. Probably due to server side reliance and poor state management in the app. Will definitely avoid."
Good habit tracking app!
Did not work how I wanted to work
"Have paid for pro version. Used to be decent but now struggles syncing with Google whereas other calendar/task apps do without problem. Have now moved to Etar as its open source, free and provides the same functionality needed."
"I'm a breath away from uninstalling this app again. Half the time it doesn't even do what it's supposed to do, some things it doesn't even let you do inside the app, you have to go to the actual browser version to do it. On that subject, the mobile browser is beyond awkward, no chance of navigating it properly! If I'm supposed to log into an actual PC just to check off that I did a workout or washed dishes, forget it. Right now the only reward I get is having my good mood ruined; certainly not worth it."
"This is a good planner because it's easy to use and understand, but the widget consumes a lot of the phone's battery."
Not being able to view my list of things to do or to get.
I am a pro user and I have purchased all ambient sounds but none of these sounds are working I checked all my settings and permissions.but also it's not working I like such doubly ambient sounds so please fix this up .it shows its playing but no sound will come .my speaker is working fine
Glitchy but good
"It would help me to better schedule my tasks if the feature to repeat a task could be made to be more fluid, i.e. instead of only allowing users to key in ""every week"", ""every day"" etc., it would be better if it allows ""Aug 28, Oct 5, Nov 11"" ."
"The best app to become a better person and acheive your daily goals developing great habits! The whole community is cheerful and i may thank you for taking the time to develope such great considerate features for free, you've really helped us all 💖💖"
Good - the only thing it has that isn't on my Samsung cal is Agenda view. Crappy- My SCal has dark mode. BusCal - you can basically F off if you're vision impaired. Font size & dark mode are paid only. Not fun to test drive in the bright white light. UNINSTALL...
Like the app. Either I haven't found it or they don't have it in the free app but I would like to see a calendar with all the habits listed each day. Would be fun to see at the end of the month all that I did on one calendar.
"I like the app and it works to improve my productivity, but the notifications almost never show up and the whitelist mode doesn't work sometimes. I wish there was a way to change the ground color for the day/week/month, and it's quite annoying that the flowers are as big as trees."
"I LOVE THIS APP, ITS VERY HELFUL FOR ME TO DO MY ROUTINE."
Love this app. Its helped me with my motivation and procrastinating. I've been more motivated since using it. But I'm having a very frustrating issue that is driving my OCD insane. I try to move a task in my list... Only for it to disappear or move itself somewhere I didn't tell it to go. I try to keep my list in a certain order of how i should get things done and this is not helping me at all.
"This is a very good and unique app. I really like how I am able to put different types of events or plans I want to jot down. How I'm able to put a tab when it's important or a personal matter. Good notifications as well, right on time. Overall, a great app. I'm glad I came across this app, it has helped me be more organized and top of things."
It's been months and I still cannot delete this one habit. It will not delete and nothing I've been sent has been helpful to figure out why. About ready to find a different app cause it's driving me nuts.
Downloaded a bunch of these types of programs to find the one that was best. This was one of the worst. Played with it for about an hour and couldnt figure it out.
"So far, felt good."
Suuuper helpful with school and I still use it for daily life in general. It's really clean and works better than anything else I've tried. The only things I'd change would be making the widget able to be pulled down a little more and being able to choose custom colors for the priority feature.
There is no notification sound when the timer ends
"Has failed to sound and show tasks at the right time or at all, yet still put the recurrence on for the day after. I have a reminder set for every two weeks but it went off after only one week so I took my medication too early, fortunately no harm done to me. Uninstalled."
not worth it if you can't go pro
The update is annoying. I want to add time on the list. But you just add time tag feature which make the time that i put not being displayed.
"Every now and then appears to disconnect from certain calendars. Support didn't have an answer. Otherwise, I love it."
It doesn't automatically fill date for due date as wonderlist did.
can't even name my tasks
"its a cool app, it really is, but developers need to understand that a subscription based system is not for every app. im fine paying a subscription fee to netflix, or Spotify because there is new content almost daily, but i refuse to pay a subscription fee for a todo list app. make a payed app, ill buy it for 30 bucks, what i wont is give you 3 bucks a month everymonth and add yet another subscription fee to my list"
Exceptional
"Awesome! Loved that it performs a lot of things, a multi-functional tool. Plus it intergrates well with other tools, too."
It says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie.
"Don't receive any notifications, alarms"
Stupid decision to remove timer.
"I really wish it was possible to see an entire month or maybe just a week at a time, instead of only 1 day at a time. You could click on a date to go back to only seeking 1 date at a time, but it should be possible to have an overview of your week. It's honestly huge problem and it could boost my rating from 3 to 5 stars if they make this an option."
"Why this app not giving any notification sound after the set time?? (Everytime After updates) this is not the first time this happen. Need to unistall n insall again for the sound. N after that, all ur progress n track in the past are all lost jz cz u hv to uninstall as there are no more notification sound. (Ps : Phone not in silent!! )"
No subscription tank you. Please full price. I no lack forever.
"Updating to 4 stars because push notifications are now live.. Not Fully Developed. This app could be great, but in their rush to put it out, the features are highly lacking. No push notifications, you cannot upload stickers, no widget, pretty buggy. I really liked the idea of it, but it needs improvement. I will update to 5 stars if and when these features are added. They did reach out to me to resolve my issues, so I am updating to three stars."
I'm find this app useful but I'm trying to use it on my desktop? Currently it is not possible. I will adjust this rating once i can
"Hi, today the editing or deleting of events stoped working. When selected to be edited the event opens in a window without it's name and if you choose edit the window closes and goes back to the calendar. Also by swiping your finger on the list it can not be deleted. I really love the app, it's has worked perfectly so far but like this it's useless, please advise. Kind regards, Marta Santos"
Infuriating keyboard gets in way cannot be closed
I was looking to hold myself more accountable for things I need to do every day and at certain times. I wish it had weekly/monthly statistics for completed vs missed but it has helped me a lot.
"Very effective, however for the past few weeks (maybe months), the countdown timer continues despite opening apps out of my whitelist."
This app is really good but can somebody please fix its crash report for vivo users ....I don't know ... every now and then it sends crash reports...all my earned coins ... brought trees...all lost.....
"I bought the pro version yesterday and today in the morning it's asking me to purchase again ... Contacted the developer and if no answer is received within 12 hours, I'm reporting this app for fraud."
"Has been one of the best reminder app available for a long time. This most recent update messed up notifications on Android 10. They don't follow the system dark mode at all, instead you have to manually change it in the app or deal with mismatched colors. It looks ridiculous seeing a white notification background amidst other black backgrounds in dark mode. It also looks like the black is not a true black like other apps. If this isn't fixed soon, I'll be looking for a new reminder app."
"Pay for everything except if you are here only to create and delete tasks. You have to pay for reminder, label, comments or for atleast the dark theme."
Not in sync with my google account. Bad in regards to automatically getting what I planned and plus I can't use it when i am using my PC!!! But thumbs up for this Sectogragh the idea is brilliant. Please work on updates because very soon i might not use it if i still have to re-enter all my days task and activities!!! It should be able to get data from my google account and i should be able to use it on PC. PC is really perfect use for this kind of app!!!
I newly use hope it Will be good
Only 5 habits. If you dont want to pay it's not worth having.
"The app helps me alot and the idea is GREAT, but the app crashes alot and I have to re-install it constantly which obviously removes my saved data being a free user which just demotivates me because I have to start all over again."
Nice application it was really very useful I did my work on time I was so much free time so that's good news I love it I'llI give u guys 5 🌟 stars. I want another to do app it must have talking alarm and please reply me THANKS FOR THE VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY VERY NICE APP bye
Simple and easy to use. Available for windows too so i can sync with my laptop. Good eficiency.
"App is great overall, but unless I'm missing something obvious I can't seem to put the widget on my home screen?"
"I started getting notifications but all came at the same time instead of their specified times, so just removed them and no longer use. Biggest feature I would like see fixed is there seem to be issues with using the ""Today"" option for the task list Widget. Sometimes will only show one task and sometimes when I can complete all my tasks, the next day the list doesn't refresh, still says ""All tasks are done!"""
"Irrespextive of having task completed, there should be a way of having access to your ""do list"" as long as it is not deleted. One might want to crosscheck a few sruffs. They should fix that issue."
not good worst app
"I removed this paid app. I missed about a dozen events over the few months I owned this. I would look at the app a few minutes after an event was supposed to pop up, and it showed that it had missed. I'm trying out Simple Calendar, which testing seems to work better."
"I use this app often, it keeps me accountable. One thing I'd add is the ability to clear all the days previously done in a single habit in order to restart it. Other than that, I still use this app daily."
I want to say just add on the feature to check the box/things which i have done from my daily time boxing schedule
"Pls and pls, kindly refund me. I was charged yesterday. I didnt realize that i was still subscribed to the app because i deleted it. I cant afford it right now cuz i dont have a job and i still need to pay my tution fees. Pls refund me!! Crying** pls refund my money"
"The free version has HORRIBLE ADS. Other than that, the app is marginally better than Google's free calendar app that had no ads... It was an easy decision to uninstall and go back to Google calendar."
Well I used this app for quite some time and it started having issues. The app didn't open at l for days and I eventually ended up uninstalling and reinstalling it. It looked like the problem was solved and the app started working again. I use the free version on an android phone. If not this I would give it a 5. Is there any solution to this?
"Great app, but I have one issue. My tasks that I create on my phone doesn't sync with google tasks. How to fix it?"
"This is actually really useful, given the kind of arrangement they chose - showing tasks like the arms of a clock so it's really convenient for us to know , at what time which tasks are there to complete. But the problem is that when there are more than one task at the same time, the texts superimpose on each othr and we can't read thm. Considering they use Google calender to set up the tasks, I feel like Google calender itself & its widget is more useful than this. But 5/5 for User Interface🤩"
"A good starter app 4 collecting the data you need to better your daily life. Limited flexibility, in the free version, but sufficient four basic tracking of self-improvement efforts. Easy to get started. And so I can do without cute reminder and encouragement features, they are easy enough to toggle off."
"Pro Version and it still won't handle the recurring tasks smoothly. Please fix it, I've restarted my phone several times and still nothing."
This app is surprisingly helpful in stopping you from using your phone. The fact that the more coins spent on the app will plant more real trees making it extra fun.
"Had been very good. But now any reminder that is not completed by the end of the day gets marked as complete inatead of showing up as overdue. On repeating tasks, sometimes marking today's as done will also mark 1, 2, or even 3 days into the future as done, with no pattern behind the glitch. Has become very cumbersome to use and has resulted in many tasks getting missed."
Not as I required
Very nice 👍
"Recurence tasks does not work properly, otherwise I would give 4 starts."
Too much ads appeared out of no where.
Please allow to set the time on the due date so the tasks can also be sorted by time. Overall great performance on all my devices.
"One of the main sticking points for me is how well an app does recurring tasks. In particular, not just fixed date recurrences, but the ability to set the next date off the last completion date. So many apps fail to offer this. Alas, I could find NO way to do a recurring task at all, in spite of them saying it can be done. So, much less checking on this nuance, I see no way of doing them at all. Fail. Moving on."
doesn't sync to my smartwatch 😞
"My favorite app for studying! I love the music and sound effects and how chill and relaxing this is! would give 5 stars but I think you should remove needing to get pro for accounts, friends and planting irl trees, I want to help plant more trees but I don't have pro.. and playing with friends is more motivating, but overall love this and totally recommend!"
This planner pro is very nice and better for you time schedule
Use it every day to organize my life. It is easy to use and synchs with my Google calendar.
It stopped showing reminders and notifications!!!!!
"Can't really do anything on the free version. No reminder, no scheduling"
Chinese
"This is cool, I'm on my first day and just put in all my major daily goals like exercising and reading. You can customize the traits that are rewarded by each activity, as well as penalties for failure. You can even link customizable titles to your level progression (my personal goal: Archwizard of the Order of Ptolemy). Very few features are locked behind the paywall, and everything that is essential is free."
"It is a great idea, don't get me wrong, but why the need for a chat room?"
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse
"I have been using this app everyday but last update cleared all my future reminders. Now its impossible to recollect those important reminders. Searching for better alternative. REPLY : awesome, tried your advise to sign out and sign in...but lost yesterdays reminders also...fyi i had requested forgot password for this account."
Awesome planner
"EDIT, Paid out GOOD money last year to buy Premium BUT you're STILL begging me to RATE YOU. Well my original 5 stars becomes today's 3 stars. Leave me alone, I rated 5 within minutes of buying !! ~ Old Review ~ I've purchased the PREMIUM version, thank you, the best in the play store. EDIT ~ I would appreciate it if next time you have a one day sale you make it abundantly clear in the actual app otherwise I'll never know. Thank you."
"I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for."
Chinese app👎
"its awesome but needs an improvement,it would be nice if i could visit my notes and edit my notes online in my pc not just through the phone"
"During Corona my schedule is off I just seem to float and often forget the most routine things, now I am trying to get myself back into a routine, this will be a great tool for daily reminder."
I like the way this app looks. Helps me feel I'm achieving things!
An ace planner app
I'm using the premium version.Recently it stop updating the total time focused by itself when comparing with other friends.
"I understand the function of the switch. What I meant is that once I had attended to a reminder, I could delete it so that I could remain with a clean slate for future use. Now, combining events and reminders makes it hard to have a clean slate at the beginning of each day cause you can't delete recurring events. I just want reminders tab that's separate from events so that I can always clean my reminders up at the end of each day and know which ones need to be done the next. The app was so elaborate when events and reminders were separate functions."
"Only complaint is how often it asks you to rate it. Other than that, the app is even so great IMO that it's work buying the subscription. I love how customizable it is. For sure one of my top 5 favorite apps."
The interface is very beginner friendly and the tutorial shows you how everything works. You can share your streaks with others to inspire and motivate them. It even reminds you everyday to use the app just in case you forgot to use it. This app is the best for quitting addictions.
"I paid for habitbull premium for the sync functionality, which fully does not work. I've tried reinstalling the app, reinstalling android, getting a new phone. No luck. Emailed habitbull a month ago and still no reply. If I want to take a backup I have to screenshot everything. not ideal Apart from this the app is decent. It's got a cute meme"
"Neat concept, just not for me."
Works fine but the ads are horrible. Every time I enter something new I have to watch a slow ad. I'm removing it!
"There is a big banner of a cat and a dog with sime motivational lines on the home page. Also, i can't set up reminder every 2 days although i can set up a habit every two days."
Perfect. Only option I would like to have extra is the possibility to see the schedule clock on the screen of the phone before unlocking it in order to have it accessible with just one click
This app is helpful 👍 😀 but should have some more section like tasks or something for students
Has been a phenomenal program! It has helped keeping my life on track and on schedule. I'm mega high while i write this. But it's a great tool!
great app
"Love it, some pay features are annoying"
Only notifications pop out no sound at all
"Task repeat options are garbage. For basic things it's ok, but don't expect more than that."
"I had a problem with upgrading to Premium. They were quick with their response and fixed the problem right away. It's a good app for those familiar with the Franklin Covey system, and syncs well across devices."
Cool
"Almost perfect. If you could make option so tasks tabs can be little smaller, that is more compact, it would be perfect app. It would save screen space, and fit more tabs on screen."
"Good App. Lots of customization. But i have noticed an issue with repeating sub-tasks. If a subtask is set to repeat, it won't complete the main task. Seems to complete fine if the subtasks are not set repeat."
Keeps me on top of things
Its ok. Looks great. Sends reminders. A couple of features available in free version. ★Cannot add hyperlinks ★constant push to upgrade [additional comment in regards to developer respons ] : How can i add hyperlink in notes? seems like it can only be stored as text
"It's okay application however it is not that practical. Reason is more 
often than not I have some event I'd like to add and shift around my 
routine. This is not possible at the moment (using programmer for 2 out of 
3 days is meticulous just so I can add 1 event). It would be good to have 
the ability to move and split routine items with events. In essence make 
programmer less of a hustle, and more natural and quick to use."
"It's a good app that lets us develop 5 habits if one isn't a pro user. I think it's a good idea to start small since developing a habit, just one habit, takes atleast 2 months if not mistaken. Overall satisfied."
the reviews are sending a clear message to you. Act on them. I think the last update has messed everyone up. If you don't act;you're sending a message back:ie. you meant to mess everyone up by locking them out
I cant Register on this app. It always says 'server connection lost '.
"The new update remove the option to change only one event when it is on repeat, now i need to copy and select.. And could have more colors!! Paid version"
It's been a good app but I can't sign in now. I can't even renew my premium membership. I love this app but it's been like this for long. You will always be redirected to the sign in page everytime you sign in
"Have to register and the app doesn't even work. Nothing happens when you press ""let's start""."
"I didn't see an option for smart lists like ""today"". Is there a way to put meditate a on a folder? I've been investigating options for my replacement of Wunderlist since I had to move off that.😡 I would also like a way to set up dependencies not necessarily a Gant chart but Tasks that are moved out if one has to move out that they are dependent on. Thanks just still trying it out."
Neat!
"Wish the google assistant integration could be improved. Every time I ask it to set a ticktick reminder, it just shows TikTok. Also, every time I restart my phone I need to boot up the app, otherwise the widget panel doesn't show up."
Very good app! Helps me stay organized.
How do you decrease the timing of the alarm??My only question😃
Ugh... too complicated just want plain priority list. Uninstalling.
"It's not working properly, always fails to Remind, no more reminder notification, this feature suppose to work for free version, if the promise features in free version doesn't work how can I get confident to buy paid version , request team to fix this issue"
"Great Concept but executed poorly. I added 2 events between 6.30am and 9.30 but when I tried adding one for 10.30am it would let me, saying it overlapped with another event which it did not. I even checked my calendar and nothing was there for that time. It's now 11.42am, I tried adding an event for 3.30pm and it said its saved but hasn't showed on the clock or anything so it's pretty useless at this point."
"A bit underrated. It's a fun way to get things done, kind of like having a video game character. It does take time to set up and some unnecessary options cost money, but it makes getting stuff done feel more rewarding. Good app for parents to set up for their kids as well so they are more motivated and enjoy getting chores, homework, etc, done. :-)"
"I have to reinstall it everytime, because it is not opening sometimes. And sometimes it starts responding in some other languages and can't login to my premium account. All these happens after i bought the premium version. This is such a helpful app. So i hve no other choice than reinstalling it everytime. Please fix this...! I need this app...!!"
"Dates and times? No such thing here Sure you can colorcode and organize and 
sort your tasks to death, but strangely enough there's no changing when a 
reminder will go off, no setting when a task is due (perhaps if you used 
this for work or a meeting), or not even the ability to set a due date for 
a task. It can be put in the details, but when time is of the essence 
you're better off using a better task app"
"So far so good. I like the projects and sub task features especially. Only been actively using for about a week. Great for todos, not totally sold for checklisting yet."
Nice app but requires payment for basic features.
Sometime its create a problem in log in issue to fix it.
auto fail doesn't work properly. Subtasks don't work properly for repeated goals.
"I think the app is very good, has helped me to keep track of my habits. However I wish there was a function whereby you could postpone a habit for something out of your control i.e. not going to the gym because you're on holiday. This although a break from the habit doesn't feel like it should affect the moments when you are focused and in control of keeping the habit. Also how is the success percentage measured if you only have to do the habit a certain number of times a week?"
"Reminders, the most basic of features, is ""premium"" in this app."
"Okay app, but it needs ""Do not disturb"" mode to be perfect."
"Incredible, the best app of organization."
"U should work on the phones like oppo and others so that customer don't 
find problem"
"TickTick is not a bad app by any means, but it is too complicated for my needs, so I just went back to using Google Keep, which also has an excellent sync system with its website equivalent. TickTick is especially complex when it comes to the scheduling of alerts, which always confused me to the point where I didn’t understand how to set the reminders that I wanted. TickTick is a fantastic app, but it is quite confusing. I prefer simplicity in the note-taking and reminder apps that I use."
What everyone is looking for in an app like this.
"Have tried any.do, wunderlist, Google keep, tasks, Evernote. This works the best for me especially since it allows syncing with calender."
"Love it so far! I would like to be able to move appointments around on the same day. for example, they are listed in the order you enter them. But I want my am on the top of each page and my p.m. appointments in the afternoon on the month view. it would be great if you can just drag and drop. I also would like a printing feature for my lists so that I can actually print them out while packing."
"Loved the concept, beautiful design, and has taken its place on my home screen after a clarification from the Dev on syncing other calendars.  I also love the fact that you can just jump in and use the widget, or you can opt for deep customisation of the look, feel and functionality."
The alarm doesn't work
This is a really good application for our pending task or work
This app is always being stopped and later app is not opening can u do somthing ??? I installed it 3 times because of same issue Again I am suffering from same issue Aap open hi nhi hota hai
"This app is either really good or really bad/broken --- there are no in betweens. I love the concept, and its super cute, but it bugs out quite a bit and besides which, is super easy to misclick on. As a result, I've lost or accidentally lost items, as well as accidentally spending nearly all of my coins completely on accident because there's no verification for buying and no refunding??? And that's besides the part where it constantly unequips all of my gear... This game needs help..."
"Overall its good but this new version is not working when i open store, app gets close automatically"
Subscription required just to set a reminder.
Great app
A bird's eye view to your schedule.
This is a pay to play calendar only
I would have loved this app except for the fact that I need to pay to even use it as a widget.
"Month widget failed to show the calendar month erroneously, but just show a week on the first row of the calendar month weirdly."
"Latest update is really annoying, why are completed tasks no longer sortable alphabetically? For things like shopping lists where items need to be re-added to the list regularly this makes these items impossible to find 🙄"
Great app and experience all the features are great.
Reminder is not working in Realme phone. I did all the settings in my phone and app settings but still not working.
"such a great app, so organized and clean. my favorite part that you can make your own tags! its make it way more satisfying. you should get the app for free!!!!!"
I love the widget but whenever I edit an event on the calendar it changes the day to like the day before without me doing so and it's extremely annoying
"It's useful, but the recurring task feature is a pain in the free version."
it s great
nice
This app is really great! it's very easy to use and also has an option to save a copied piece of text (each line will be taken as a separate event) as several events - this was seriously a life saver!
Deleting. Was great. Now horrible. Bad move with the ads guys.
Not sync with Google Calendar
Really like the app. However it is multiplying my tasks on a daily basis and i cant delete them as fast as they appear... frustraring not using it right now
Slow. Not user friendly. If you type fast words repeat.
Amazing app.. One request from the developers.. This app is turning humans into better humans so 'the rouge' class should be renamed to 'the Ninja' or something as it affects the subconscious brain of users without even them noticing it..(this pure psychology) And this is how low of attraction works.. Never talk or think of things which you don't want in life.. You yourself would not want anyone to be Rouge. So please give 'ROUGE' SOME positive polish.. If you can. Only a humble suggestion.
It٬s one of the best liferpg apps i have ever seen with lot of options but it can have some more beautiful transparent widgets and if you add an option that a task directly influences a characteristics it can be more comfortable
Only certain Google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless. A great idea that is flawed in execution.
"Haha you are helping by planting tree , But for that if you want to use music you should pay to devloper , What a way to get income. very nice 👍"
"Nice and simple task app, however it is missing a couple of key features that are preventing me from switching over fun my current task app. These are: 1. No ability to set multiple reminders. 2. Cannot hide tasks until a later date. For annual tasks, I do not wish to see them constantly in my to do list, I'd like them hidden until a certain date, usually 1 month before due date. Furthermore, due to the longevity of the task, I like to be reminded early and then again closer to the time."
Oohh im very hardly managing it and its a disgusting app just a waste of time. Also it is not uninstalling.
Quite user friendly.
"I like the app so far. One issue is like someone else said, why do you have to pay for the app before doing a free 14-day trial? Second, why don't the notifications pop up where I can see them? That was one of the main reasons that I got the app. I need to be constantly reminded of what I need to do. I have ADHD and remembering a bunch of things that I have to do is a HUGE issue."
"Please at least put an option to use the previous theme. I like the previous one with flat design (minimalist). If you could also put a feature to have other place a comment on our list, that would be great. Kindly prioritize the option to use the minimalist/flat design theme... It is less distracting which makes me more productive. I recommended this to my friends because of its design... good thing my other device is not set to auto update.. i was able to retain the previous version..."
"Meh/10 Came from Wunderlist. My wife has the iPhone app, and it is a reasonably functional app. Not as full-featured, but okay. This Android app was developed by someone who who does not care about user experience. In fact, they might actively hate their users."
"All right so to be clear, this app is amazing and I'm really happy to see that someone has made their own version of it! Even though it's such a great program, it became unusable at day one. It had bugs and limitations that hindered what I was attempting to accomplish. Problems such as: inaccurate characteristics, no quick access from rewards to inventory, non removable default achievements, inaccurate values on skills after undoing a task and hidden xp multiplier from skills to characteristics."
Cannot access the app
I just like this app for it's widget. I didn't pay for the full version so I uninstalled. I'm coming back because the widget look EXACTLY how I need it to look. I wish I could JUST install the widget honestly. It's my favorite.
How to use whitelist
"A very interesting idea. I would give 5 stars, but there are minor bugs in the apps. I can't choose my user name, it says there are all taken. (I'm sure No one else would use it) and I cant add a daily task. It shows an error when I try to add one. ""is not the enum for frequency "" or something similar. please fix this, I really love this idea."
This app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when I pressed the box to tick what I've completed everytime
One of the best time optimization apps to have ever been made... Been using it for about 2 years now... Just have one or 2 nitpicks.. a hold to drag option... and possibly a chrome extension of some kind for notification if possible... other than that... it's pretty top notch!!!
This app is not the best.
Reminders are behind a paywall
แอปเด้งออกบ่อยมากเลยค่ะ เข้าไม่ได้ ข้อมูลหายหมดเลย
why doesn't adjusting habit streak reflect in health and experience (say if i accidentally clicked + or - for a habit)?
"Whould be nice if I can set the view old event larger numbers than 3 hours, 
this is kind of a deal breaker for what I use it for"
"Looking good Todo manager. The premium was already expensive for India, but I just realized that not only they increased the price, but the price Indians pay would be more than the US price. Now, that's called a rip off."
"Super simple, nice UI, love it! As convenient as post its but smarter!"
It igood
The fact that you have to pay so much to use something so simple isn't worth it to me. There are free apps of similar functionality.
After reading Reality Is Broken a couple of years ago I have tried every app out there to gamify my life and nothing has really cut it. I preferred filling in hand drawn skill boxes on a whiteboard! Until now! This is the one! I love it! Thank you so much!
I would've liked to use this app but sadly it doesn't seem to recognize European daylight saving time. I've gone through the settings twice. This is a deal breaker I'm afraid. I would still recommend people try the app however if the live in location where DST is rightfully ignored. The main concept is really clever and the widget is beautifully designed 👌👌
"I can't allocate skill points? While it's not something massive, it 
certainly is a little frustrating."
"I like how minimalistic the app is. It's very easy to use and has just the necessary features. My biggest complaint is that I can't set a custom due date. Whenever I tap the due date, I get predefined reminder and I can't seem to change it no matter what. I'm using an LG Q7 Plus, don't know if it's a bug with the device or what. Will update the score if this issue ever gets fixed."
"Great app, let's you customize pretty much anything you want to create your own system. Only reward app I kept coming back to. Has helped me to create change in my life."
I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks
"THE POP-UP AFTER U CONCLUDE A TASK IS VERY EXHAUSTIVE. IF U TAKE OFF THESE THE APP WOULD BE PERFECT. AND ALSO IF U STAY A DAY WITHOUT DOING THE TASKS, THE APP GOES CRAZY AND STOP PLACING THE TASKS CORRECT"
Amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself.
"The star rating & my comment are only for the move capability. The order within the list can't be easily rearranged. Move to top and move to bottom is the only option. There's another move which tries to move the task to the same list if you have only one list. What is needed is a simple drag and drop of a task to a different order. The 2nd option is to have only 'Move' upon touch and hold, and then pop up a sub menu. This sub menu can have up / down arrow and other move choices."
This is a pay to play calendar only
1 star (prolly less) after upgrade: U r forcing us either uninstall it or upgrade to pro. I am now regretting upgrading it without reading the comments. DAMN! Old features are already enough for me. Can I degrade it???? 5 stars b4 upgrade: This is the best calendar I ve ever used. The only thing that bother me is that this is not on the ios app store. Will this happen in the coming days because this is the only reason I am still using android.
Having trouble syncing on new device; says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong.
"It would be a very helpful app if it actually worked the way you'd expect... if I say I want a task to be weekly, but make it so I can complete that task any day, what I'm trying to do, is make the task flexible, so I can do the weekly task whatever day of the week I feel like, instead however, making it available everyday turns it into a daily task, which I will be punished for by not completing daily, my only real solution at the moment is filling up my to-do list which is really frustrating."
This app is very amazing it keeps focused
"This Agenda has changed my life. I can easily switch between family, business and personal calendars. I can color code events and the tasks lists have made my followups in business, and my daily home tasks seamless. Im no longer the mom losing my mind (as much anyway). I HIGHLY recommend!!!!"
Thanks for giving free uc
"Been using this app for a short while. So far so good. It's purely a visual of events, time, and alarms, while all the actual event management still happens through the Google Calendar app, and which I think is brilliant. Still figuring out the app.... Like how does one track time on it? 🤔"
"Just paid for this app. Latest update, I've lost some events in 1 of the 4 Google calendars I view. Those events show up just fine in the Google Calendar, and used to show up o.k. My free Business Calendar. I see you did an update July 20. Maybe there is a bug in that version. I tried stopping the app, cleared cache, cleared all data, started over. Still missing some events in one calendar. Refresh/resync doesn't help. All events showing in Google Calendar. Shut down, restarted phone, not fixed."
Базовый функционал платный.
"(I am a premium user) This is a great To-do app : tasks, habits, tags, subtasks, timer, however it lacks things that I use on a daily basis, for example: integration with Google calendar or its own calendar (to add events not tasks Edo Agenda did a great job), I wish tags could have different color so that I can distinguish them just by looking at the color, I wish it had other features like project column where you can manage a whole project (ex: trello), Integration with Google Assistant, etc."
"Wonderful application, thank you."
I love this app! It's so user friendly and helps me keep track of everything going on!
"App loding ke baad peese maang raha hai, pahle bataaye , data kyo kharaab karwaya"
"This is an excellent app for keeping notes, tasks, and lists, and for collaborating with others. It's smart, sleek, intuitive, and easy to use. My favourite aspect of it is that an app icon appears in the status bar, and one click opens a small text box for adding a quick note. This is much easier and faster than Google Notes, which I have been using, and that itself is an excellent app. I fully recommend this app!"
"It doesn't ring the alarm at the right time. only when I open my phone, it starts ringing. useless for me because I want it to ring at the right time and remind me on my realme phone. Highly disappointed! :("
عالیه من که ازش راضیم
"Your widget freezes intermittently, doesn't allow interaction. Had to remove and add widget from homescreen a few times now."
"Used the free version for years, no issues, didn't need the pro features. Then they started putting in ads - not the kind that pop up along the bottom but ones that completely hijack the screen while you're trying to work. Worst bait-and-switch I've ever seen."
Notes and tasks are appearing twice
Good
"Nice interface and it syncs across my devices. However the widget constantly crashes on both, P30 Pro, Oneplus 7T Pro."
"Tasks cannot be ordered by their time. A habit not done is not shown as overdue. EDIT: I checked again to use it, but 1) Recurring task cannot be created. 2) Habits are shown like scheduled tasks. It's motivating to see habit progress instead on landing screen 3) It's more useful to see progress on habit activity instead of successful day. If we set to do 2 times a day but we could do it only once, it should show progress for a 30 day goal as 1/2 (today), 1/60 (total) instead of 0/30 or 1/30."
"Works fine, unless you want integration with Google Calendar. It's evidently broken (reddit is filled with bug reports), and it seems they're still working on it. I hope it gets fixed soon, so I can upgrade to premium"
"I like the app, and use it for everything. My one complaint is the search mechanism does not always work; I would like it to show all items that match the search request."
"Parece una gran app, pero no se me actualiza el idioma a español, a pesar de que ya lo configure para que asi sea. Una lastima"
This app is good but there is no option of making our tasks to repeat on alternate days.
Reminders feature behind in app purchase. Seriously? Thats the most basic function of to do list. No way im going to pay you monthly just for reminders
Visually appealing.
i think I could really like this app. except I upgraded to paid and still have ads and the search function does not search notes. It will be hard to find info saved in notes if you cant search...
"I paid for it so I could track more habits......love it. Always works good,it's colorful and motivating"
"Changed my life. The group feature, when you have a family, is a must have. Seeing our avatars morph and change while we level up our life, priceless. This app is worth it, it's one of the best decisions I've made for me and my children. They're excited to do chores, and I no longer procrastinate. I just can't recommend this app enough."
good
Time zones not supported? Missed a meeting today... :(
Good job
good app but at present unable to add additional attendees to events as it causes the app to crash. also it would be good to filter lists appearing on the calendar
The timezone system is stupid the sheer number of hours I studied could be 9 while it appears on a friend's list only 2 hours. Please change that. It would be better if it counts the total hours every week or something just something about it thanks
"It's good but since we always have more than 1 thing to do we write three 
or more things to do and when we go to priorities ex:C1 A4 B2 etc; we 
wouldn't know which to do so we suggest you have more of those .Thanks."
This is an awesome app idea for really anyone to use. Just a great app
Great :)
There is a glitch in which it do not keeps track of your hours of study My target is 5 he's and if I studied for 1 hours than I add it and poof next day it shows 8930 hours
It helps a lot for me to keep track of my work
"Routine module and programming is nice. Any plans to make it a tracker app - log if the schedule event is accomplished completely, partially or not accomplished..? For example - drinking water few times a day. Exercising 1hr per day."
Awesome app. It really helps me keep my focus. There are ads but the app is well worth them.
"I prefer to use apps in portrait mode on my 7 inch phone/tablet (Huawei Mediapad X2, 1920*1200). When the keyboard pops up while adding a task, I can barely see what I'm typing because the screen height is greatly reduced in landscape."
Good
"I'm not getting free coins thru video. It is showing some error 0. ple fix this asap. This is happening very often now. I have updated a lot of times, but still I'm not getting free coins."
Ok so it's not bad but for me it was a little bit hard to work. But don't get me wrong there are probably loads of people that do understand it. It was just a little hard for me. :)
C'est très bien... mais ça devrait être moins lourd en daya
"Not sure why but sometimes when I make an edit on one of the items on the list, next time I open the app the changes are not saved. Happened couple times already and I'm sure I clicked the check mark to save the item before leaving the app. A bit annoying"
"Great app for goal makers, but there are some premium features . Please make them free to use. It's a humble request."
"The app continues to improve, but it lacks one feature for me... the ability to turn off the pop- up I get on my screen every morning to tell me it's ready to ""plan my day"". Let me make this clear...I don't want you to plan my day so stop telling me to do it. I've tried turning off all notifications, but no luck. And everywhere I go on the app it tries to sell me the premium upgrade.... just annoying."
I am very satisfied with this App. I does what i expected it to do including reminding about the things to do ans repeating tasks every month. I also love how it is super easy to use and even easier to type in the Task with predictive dates and stuff Overall great app!
It does the job
"Worked great in beginning. Enjoy multiple lists & sublists. But now I have a task ""haunting"" me, it won't let me delete it. Wrote developers, we'll see. Using SG8+."
This is one of the better todo list apps and integrates with events nicely.  It is severely let down by poor synchronisation with Google tasks (too slow or forget it) which limits its usefulness where syncing with other applications is a concern.  Others sync much more effectively.
"Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?! Furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and I had full access, there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much. Also what's the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want? And a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time, and it's not fun enough."
"This is a fun way to build the keystone habit you need to make all your other daily habits click into place. I think the mechanic of guilds is probably one of the most engaging things about it. My critique is that in order to access the challenges available from the guilds you're in, you have to get on your desktop. This is super annoying because I'd rather only use the mobile app. Fix this and it's an easy five stars."
The new full-screen video advertisements make the basic version of this app unusable. I'm looking looking for a replacement.
"Awful, it has timing issues , when I reach the end of the day , it leaves an empty task and u cant delete it."
Good experience better than before
i love the concept but i would love to see a list of suggested 'to dos' cuz i can never think of things to do
It's ok. The free version does the same thing your calender does on  your phone.
This calendar is perfect for all my business and personal appointments.
Useless without pro.
"So far I like it, however there are so many items on the lists when you first download it that it gave me anxiety. You can only delete them 1 at a time and it wants confirmation before deleting each one. If the developers see this I suggest only a few items on each list to give as an example instead of the 200+ I found on my lists that all repeated. Although the check here for downloading the app gave a lot of XP."
"Pretty good, only issue I noticed is that if you undo claiming a reward that has its price increase each claim it can give you extra coins back. Aside from that, a lifetime purchase option would be nice (I try to avoid subscriptions where possible, so I'm sticking with using this for free for now), and an option to hide the parts that require a subscription instead of showing them but asking you to pay when you click them would be nice. (e.g. so the calendar doesn't even show up on the bottom)."
"Overall I love this app and find it very useful. My main issue is sometimes my reminders don't pop up? Which is kind of irritating considering I use it to remember my birth control. When it doesn't remind me, I'll often completely forget to take it or remember a few hours after when I'm supposed to take it. Like I said, love this app and use it to track when I go to the gym or remembering my pills. Just wish my reminders would work :("
"This app keeps me very orginized, with no trouble, i went through countless routine apps, but this one is defentily the best."
Stopped
"Terrible for free use, can't even schedule reoccuring events all at once- have to re-enter everything each time they occur! When you have a lot of things that happen every day, several others once a week, still more at other intervals, this App is useless unless you PAY."
"i wish it worths its price in the future. currently it doesn't support much. i haven't used it for months. i bought premium in December, 2019, Since then, i'm waiting an update they promised to release, however it's not happening. // last update improves a bit, so i changed to 2 stars."
Its a good app for everyday tasks. It takes time to customize it and its normal because its an RPG type. However I think im not the only one who encountered this annoying bug where if you want to change a task from lets say termless to always repeat every day the task remains termless. You can solve this problem by deleting the task and making another with the setting you want. This bug was very frustrating because i thought i did something wrong but yeah..
I couldn't even log in
em app ra bai ardham ai sasthaledhu
"Beautiful idea, bad design"
"Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads"
Useless unless it gets updated so we can use it offline as well. The best time I have for updating it is en route to & from uni and I can't do that without internet. Otherwise it would have been a bomb app. :(
"Would you please add ""confirm before swiping left to delete a task"". Sometimes I just accidentally swipped a task and I didn't notice, and the task just disappeared.. Besides, it would be wonderful if To Do is able to assign both start-date and end-date to a task. Thank you!"
"Great app, but needs to be able to switch accounts easily. I have an account for personal life, and work life. On my phone it is very difficult to switch back and forth and keep my other apps happy that are connected to todoist."
It doesn't ring to notify me
I have been using this app for years. What l especially like is the simplicity of use..
"Realmente ayuda mucho, me sirvió bastante pero.. Parece haber un problema con las notificaciones sonoras, solo me avisa visualmente. Por eso lo califico como 4 estrellas"
The splash screen says the account is free forever. But to have reminder of events / tasks a fairly fundemental aspect to a task reminder app its £3 per month. That's quite misleading. #response to the developer. Thank you for responding. The main point is that a reminder function is a key aspect of a to do list rather than a premium feature.... best wishes with the app.
I like this app. It's simple and gets the job done. Only downside is you're allowed to track up to only seven habits without the premium version.
Not as advertised
but it keeps crashing in the middle of a sessio . also i keep having problems when logging in. so i only fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling it 😞 please fix this bug.- previous review i did send my problem to your app platform and apparently i just have to disable auto update from both playstore and the appstore of oppo. thank you!
Bought the planner pro.... Love the app... The down side is that the app did not sync... i have 2 device handphone and tablet both android... i have to update both device twice instead of once... Would give 4 or 5 star if it can sync between both device. i have some suggestion... maybe can input some bill tracker and some cute icon or pill tracker/ hydration icon.
Very good application for life managing
Unlock
"At first this app worked well, then the next day this app stopped notifying my next activities. It stucked on the last activity before the next day"
This app is not good if you don't buy the subscription.
"Difficult to use, so much ads"
Definitely the best planner as I have been a user for the past 3 yrs.
"Good, easy to use app but alarms don't go off unless you're on the app, haven't tested notifications yet"
👍🏼
I use the app daily for virtually everything from minor reminders to major projects.
Sometimes gets dates wrong e.g religious holidays. Not as intuitive as others. Ok for basic use.
"Very nice app, has everything required for tracking habit. Please introduce option to change unlock pin."
Worst app ever thought it was good quality but no! This app really annoyed me now you have to pay to study properly
Cool lil thang. You gotta get used to the controls but it is helpful when you're consistent.
"I normally don't review apps, but this one is amazing. This digital planner was exactly what I wanted. Give it a try, you won't regret it."
"This app was exactly what I was looking for. a visual of the day in clock form. Only issue is, if I add something to the clock it adds it to my calendar. I don't want that. I want an app where the calendar and app are separate. This was supposed to be for studying and exercise. I didn't want to have to add those things as into my ready packed calendar. it was a fast uninstall. Iif there was an option to disconnect the two, I'd reinstall."
"i love the ideia but the executation is not good, i want to put reminders for every day and know what i need to do in a clock like that, this app needs his own callendar and clock for we customize without messing up anything on the original apps in the phone, this need a every day reminder, routine and stuff"
Good idea but this isn't for me. I am much more for classic habit apps.
Installing is very slow
"I think this app retarted my samsung tab S3 SM-T825Y itself. I had reset my tablets just to know what was my problem. When i reinstall ticktick, it started restart again. Like malware or something. Please fix."
"The MOST IMPORTANT features needed: 1) a MULTIPLE sort features like alphabetical, then by priority, date, etc (we are talking about very organized people using these lists) 2) a data import and export feature to backup & import lists (csv files so the 500k+ people who used ListMaster can transition to your app) while keeping our info safe (if our phone dies or is lost or stolen) 3) a feature to attach files or pictures Make ALL of these additional features for $1 month to get monthly income"
The ads are a joke. Completely destroyed the experience. Maybe they haven't tried searching for calendar on the play store and noticed the hundred other options? Look elsewhere for calendar needs!
Ok. Not as easy to add a project after task has been entered. A little clunky moving task to next day.
I'm Loving the experience so far!! Just fo future updates could you guys please allow this as a default Google assistant task 🙏
"Almost Perfect, an option to export Archived Habits (preferably to excel) would be Great.."
great app
The best
im so confused with this app
This application is very good. Feature rich and most powerful. Even though you should add few features in the app.   1- Repeat frequency should have hourly and 30 minutes  2- Add bullet points format in the notes section. Like Google keep have.  3- Provide database backup option with Google Drive and Dropbox.
Great app. Love that it links to my Google calendar.
I just downloaded this yesterday and I am enjoying this app so far. Especially the sound after you finished a specific task. I am happy that I found this app. I will use this for work and everyday goals. Thanks! 😊
An improvement would be to see running total on all habits page. Quite expensive for what it does
This is so helpful! I use this with the forest app to stay on task. You can add different calenders from Google and keep work and personal separate.
i wish to have flexible goal like do xx minutes exercise per week/month
"I was looking for an App like Forest to improve focus and avoid distractions during work. Love the concept as it connects emotionally too especially the tree-lovers. However the deep focus mode, I feel makes me insecure about data security and I wonder why this is an additional requirement, when the purpose of App is to make one stay focussed. Whitelist make sense, but giving permission to access the notifications is not something that makes me feel good about the App."
Great app and easy to use. All my lists in one place. Love it
"This is a simple app and should not have any premium features and yet, one of the most important things about an online to-do list: a reminder notification, costs money."
This is the reason I get straight A's I'm continuing with my studies and doing well in these times.The only problem I have is that once you get use to the rain sounds make focus it takes a WHILE to get use to another sound but in conclusion I really LOVE this app ❤️
"So far, its working for me. I needed something that could ring or vibrate."
"Agree with other reviewers - Wunderlist worked much better. Have issues with items not synching between devices, takes a long time to manually synch, uploading attachments to items doesn't seem to work without restarting the app, the Windows pc version is particularly poor. Appears Microsoft have mucked around with the code base and broken a really good app :("
Always reliable when I needed it. Easy to use.
"The background is very bland, you could have more colors. I also noticed that the app keeps crashing"
"This app was a life saver for me. But its not working properly with my new OnePlus 7. It doesn't gives reminders which I set for whatever time. I get it once in a while, but most of the time no reminder. Please provide a solution for this asap. Thanks. Edit (7/7): It started working now. All I did was, in the battery settings, selected Any Do app, n selected the option Dont Optimize in it."
Pretty good overall. Notifications and reminders do not work most of the time.
Not being able to add anyone to a to do list is just wrong.
"App is slow and unresponsive, makes using it a pain"
Tối rất hài lòng về ứng dụng. Nếu sau 1 tuần tôi dùng thấy ok thì tôi sẽ nâng cấp lên bản trả phí coi như ủng hộ các bạn
Doesn't go to portrait
"Nice idea with a few issues: some tasks never seem to go away. Whether I say I did them or fail or skip or try to edit they always stay there for the same day. Also, if I miss one day it takes forever going through each missed task and either skipping or failing or deleting or whatever. And like I said sometimes that doesn't work. Fix these issues and I could really get behind using this app."
Its okay so far but im not sure on how to find the focusing tree part in order for me to stay focused just wondering how you do it other than that not too bad of an app
"Great app, absolutely love it HOWEVER! I paid for the Platinum (Premium+) 
yet I am still unable to get any of the premium features. Tried adding new 
goal/habit and it still says I need to get premium to have more than 5. 
Please fix this as I have paid for the service and cannot access it."
"love the idea! but the execution is kind of clumsy. there's little to no guidance with regard to how parties or challenges work, and the rewards seem to be random at best. the graphics are adorable and the app definitely has potential though! but it would be more user friendly to streamline the app because it can be overwhelming with so many choices and options (i.e. mounts, food, eggs, etc) that seem mostly arbitrary."
"It's really a good app,but they need to add some more features to it like copy schedule and some other good features."
"I can't pay for it?? It says ""platform error"" something about ""IAP not prepared"", so can't do free trial either...please help"
"It's good, but I don't like how it makes me feel bad for how unproductive I am... But that's just me! Nothing against the program"
"Good app. a lot of useful features. As a premium customer, I would like to have the ability to export to an excel or spreadsheet program for reporting purposes. Also, the app freezes a lot on Windows"
This is good app but इसमे एक बदलाव करना चाहिए कि जब तक टास्क कम्पलीट न हो फ़ोन को चला न सके अप्प ऑन है और यूट्यूब चला रहे है
"Very useful app if you are in the habit of forgetting things. But it has one major defect. If you have set up a recurring reminder and if you miss one instance of that reminder, further instances will never show up. They are gone forever. I had to pay a penalty fee for late payment into my credit card because of that ridiculous bug."
Great app. I just wish it could be more interactive such that memebers in a shared task could chat among them selves without leaving the app
"Sound now works but when I have the phone's Do Not Disturb feature on my wake up alarm task notifies but no sound. I have it set to ignore Do Not Disturb and have it set to alarm. My other alarm app does sound off during this time but not as reliable as Task, so it's not my phone causing no sound issue, what else could it be Stephen? You get it working and you get 4 stars, restore still does not work, gave up on that."
"Guys you created a great app that I'd been using for years, but the latest update is weird. Modal views when selecting a single task (WHY do I need it instead of previous submenu for rescheduling??), no ability to choose multiple tasks (only by top menu - select tasks), strange icons.. That all makes me really sad. Rolled out to the previous friendly Todoist :("
Odd that it doesnt count beginning and end of month corrctly in monthly tally
Junk
The pop up adverts are so loud ... Terible !
Missing the widget for iOS A to-do/reminder app is incomplete without a widget. Otherwise 5 stars.
Just using basic to track milage. Works fine.
"I used to really love this app and I still do for its flexibility and functionality. I was considering getting the pro version but because I am a small business owner, it was not yet necessary. Since the recent change to the new add format, I am watching full screen adds and waiting for them to finish (oftentimes no skip option). The adds are so obnoxious that the first time it appeared I tought I was hacked. It's hampering my productivity and now it has also put me off getting the pro version.."
Awesome app! Looking forward to upgrading to pro version for more functions.
I like this app and have been using it for a while but have started noticing appointments I put in the calendar don't sync to Google and some how disappear out of my calendar so I have no idea when they are. Extremely frustrating since i don't always notice the appointment has disappeared.
"After using this app for two months, it suddenly started not responding. So I have to redownload it, nd now my all data has been lost(all the tree species nd focused hours). Plesae provide sync option so that we don't loose it again. Thank you!"
Can't get account created. Tried linking facebook and straight account creation... will not let me progress past sign in page.
"Missing one key feature that is a deal breaker for me. I MUST have the option to create recurring tasks based on date of completion. Ex: If I have a recurring task set up to complete every 10 days, but I actually go 15 days before completing it, I don't want to be reminded again in 5 days. I want the next due date to advance 10 days from whenever I last completed it. It's unfortunate because I love everything about this app, but won't subscribe to the paid version until this feature is added."
"Very good for starting small. I remember downloading a similar app without a limit and I was very quickly overwhelmed by the number of goals I set for myself. I like only being able to track 5, it motivates me to reach those goals as soon as I can so I can set and work towards setting more. I also love the motivational quotes under the ""All Habits"" section."
"So cool, but insanely expensive. Also, wasn't clear how to get started even with the manual. I have no reading comprehension issues, there is just no ""getting started"" section or similar. Then I saw the fees, $50?! WOW that is high! I hate when people gripe that they're asked to pay for apps & am a big fan of supporting developers, but $50 is nuts. This isn't a service one subscribes to, ex. Spotify, and $50 is NUTS to purchase an app. Not trying to be mean & am fine paying but $50 is way high."
it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want. to much work not worth it
"I love the app but recently the widgets have been glitching, they go blank or sometimes do respond when I click a checkbox."
Fun. Versatile!
App starts ads after 1 month and opens wanting paid every time after the first month.
The tracker has a clean interface and it's simple to set up habits. I've only experienced one glitch: sometimes when you're looking at the calendar view of a habit the heading won't show up. If I could improve the app I would make the habit description show up in the habit calendar page. Right now you have to click on the habit name to view the description. I would also make an option to include skip days so if you need to skip a habit it doesn't count against your streak progress.
It needs the ability to put stickers on the priorities and tasks. Also needs push notifications for reminders of events. It's essentially just a pretty google calendar with less customization and automatic features.
"Just one thing and I will definitely change to 5 stars. Make the 'Quick add bar' easier to use! Just expand the letter 'ADD A TASK' in the notification bar. Or at least make it easier to reach when using one hand. I'm right handed but the 'add a task' is located on the bottom left of the bar so it's hard to reach with a thumb. Please, I believe it's not too much to ask for."
Everything is under pro version.
"Downloaded this app hoping for a fun way to form new habits, but when I get to the register screen the first two tutorial panels are blank and then the third one lets you link social media accounts. Then I can't save the username and display name I create, and the avatar generator screen doesn't load any options. Opened the app the next day to find nothing I could edit had been saved. Uninstalled and tried registering again with a different account and got the same results. Pretty disappointed"
I just switched from Wunderlist. Why cant I share my list with my family to add or delete from?
Why its so hard to sync
Simple but well designed and attractive layout that is easy to set up and use. I use it to keep me mindful of my eating and exercise.
"Getting annoying, reminder keep jumping out although the task is set one month later. Start Looking for alternatives"
I really like it. I think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits. Only thing I wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits
"Very nice app. It will be great if the app includes 'number of reminders' in reminder setting instead of setting reminder after first alert. Eg. If user wants 3 reminders after gap of specified intervals (15 min/ 1 hour) for a task, then user will be free from extending reminder as per current way given in app. Thanks."
I really enjoyed this app but now if I delete a daily reminder I still get the notification for it! Which is highly annoying! Please fix this it distracts me from my work each time I here my notification go off for a deleted reminder
"This calendar was great until the ads. They are out of control, you can not go back, the x button does not work, and they are way more often than ever 18hrs as stated by the maker. If you can get past the crazy ads then its great but, I am over it and can't handle it anymore."
"Really awesome app, I think the best one. The only it lacks web version, since it takes kinda complicated process to create and manage all this tasks and habits. With web version it would be much easier."
App is pretty good but everytime I add an item to my to-do list or habits etc it goes back to the party tab. So annoying to go back to tasks every time I add something
Garbage
Gooood app it helps me Alot!!
im only doing this because it would not stop telling me give then a rating. (hence the lower score) pretty good app and the best part is it has a widget and only a one time fee to have full access to app.
Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better
Good app that I can use for putting all my appointments in. One problem is that the notifications I set to make sure it reminds me don't go off at all. (I have a Droid Turbo 2). If you guys could fix that. I will change to 5 stars.
not a bad app but DONT pay for the premium. The widgets dont work!!
"I like the app a lot, bit I can not make the notifications sound to work. I have enabled all notifications in setting - both the phone and the app but the only notification I'm getting is in the notification bar? Without the notification sound the app is quite useless."
Nice app for remainders
"been a few years - I just use it, which says a lot of positive about the design."
The one thing that made this app better than the others was that it was ad free. Uninstalling.
I wasted my time and money because it doesn't sync to my watch. I spent hours trying to get it to work. I emailed the developer a few times but it took a few emails before he realized that his program doesn't sync to the gears s3.
So far so good..Im seeing if its worth paying for...Ive tried sooo many organizational apps.
I cannot get the widget I designed to show up on the screen.  I went through the FAQ with no success.  I have a galaxy S8 plus with android 7.
interesting
I have been using BC2 for a long time. I generally like it but the month view widget just stopped displaying my calendars unless I hit the refresh button. I use Nova launcher. Please help!
I Recently changed from wunderlist. I had no problems whatsoever with Wunderlist it's perfect for me. Today I needed to use my to-do list and it has signed me out !!!. After a load of mucking around with passwords I finally got into it but it was too late to do the task that was required.
Simple function like sort by name isn't working. Shame.
"It's ok but I wish I could move activities around in a routine instead of having to manually change the time one by one E.g. if I have yoga 9-10 then study 10-12 and want to swap them I can't just move around the blocks I have to delete study, change the time of yoga then add study with the new time. It's time consuming and not practical. Would also be good to be able to change settings of a routine e.g. from 4 days to 2 instead of deleting the entire routine and start over"
"Tried many habit tracking apps, this one keeps it simple while maintaining primary functionalities that is expected from a habit tracker. No need for other day planner apps."
"I love how this works, but maybe increase the amount of coins you get."
"Widget is horrible. Keeps switching to ""my day"" and won't allow me to change it. Really expected better from Microsoft."
I like the app. I use the weekly planner widget thw most so it is easier to get organized. It syncs with Google calendar. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 stars is becauae after an update it stopped updating the week on my screen and I have to search for the right week everytime.
"I want to make a note buy present for April but it always converts to buy present due April 1st. I have tried ""April"" instead of April but it also doesn't work. Edit: April' works. It's the most elegant solution I can find. I can't find a way to just type text. If there would be and easy to understand way I'd give 5 stars."
The settings don't work well and it's really confusing when it doesn't function at all!!!! 😤
Easy to use. As described.
the app is awesome. but it made my phone drain 30% battery per day in the background which makes it useless
"It's really handy for specific dates and categories, but I would love it if there were more customising and theme options that are not for the premium package."
"Overall a well-designed app that I would otherwise use, except for the lack of Google Assistant integration, a la Todoist."
Good balance of task options and simplicity has made this my go-to to-do app at the moment. You can see Microsoft's Outlook experience shining through with the options that are available on the tasks but you can also see that they've thought about the user experience rather than just making Outlook tasks look better. The list groups and My Day allow enough organisation without over-complicating it. Nice job Microsoft.
I have paid to upgrade this app as I find it great using over years. However I wasn't able to transfer the paid pro version to my new cellphone. What do I need to do to recuperate?
I really like this app so far. Its flexible ans very customizable. The only thing I would add is either more categories/the ability to add my own. Health and Home are very broad categories. So being able to have sub categories would be nice
"Been using this app or the one before it for years now. It's a great app that has only improved with time. Loving the new colors. Only thing I could wish for is a more customizable print page, but it's rare that I need to print my calendar. It's one of the few where I paid for the upgrade, mostly out of appreciation for a well done, well supported app. Not in any way affiliated with the app, nor did I receive anything for this review."
"A few months ago i downloaded this app and it's good. But recently, i can't open this app anymore. Tried reinstall for many times but still crash. I always update this app but still the same"
Difficult login forces work or school address. Lost Wunderlist lists as a result
Useful function require paid membership. Doesn't solve the purpose
Useless app. It dint give any notification.
"I put this app on my tablet I share with my daughters and it helps me teach them how to understand time blocks. We both get reminders of the schedule we are on (play time, lunch time, movie time, pick up time) and they learn to recognize the colors on the widget with the ones on the clock we have. My daughter loves watching it to tell me what we are doing next."
"A few months ago it started to fail to sync with my employer Exchange server. I used to make it work manually, but now it doesn't work even if I ""sync now""."
"It's a great app and very useful, but I would like for it to add an options. ""Delete after completion."" This means it would repeat until you hit the check button."
I've been using this app for about 2 years. I like the way you can customize so many aspects if you want but it is simple to use out of the box. I use the widget almost exclusively.
"Lovely, very useful and simple to use. Multiple lists of tasks are available from the widget. Just one quibble, couldn't find a way to restore a list I accidentally deleted with a side swipe."
"Please add Data synchronisation with Google Drive...So, when we change device we can get our old Data on signing in"
App is very buggy. Completed tasks keep showing up as not completed. Notification alarm won't work. Uninstalling.
super cute and motivating but the server seems to constantly bug out on me
"Little hard (time it takes) to move things around, prioritize."
Helpful without being overbearing/annoying. Have enjoyed utilizing it the last couple weeks to remind me of tasks I need to get done.
"It sounds crazy but this app has basically changed my life. I'm more productive every day as this game motivates me to get my life together. I like how I can give myself credit even for the little things, the house chores no one will pay you to do or thank you for but that still need to be done. It can also be very social if you want it to be."
App install page says nothing about it being a free trial for 2 weeks. So you have to pay to use this app. This is not disclosed on the app page from which you initiate install.
"I'm considering uninstalling this previously wonderful app: since the last update, the widget has gone completely unresponsive..."
"Nice layout, but it will not sync repaired events between my tablet and phone. I contacted tech support but they were unresponsive and not helpful. I do not recommend."
First thing that happened upon opening is asking for payment. Good job.
"Once I figured out how the graph worked, it was easy to jot things down. I wasn't confused about how it worked."
"Used to be a great app, but I've moved phones, but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost. Even after having paid $18 for premium. Very much a shame."
Needs premium subscription for dark mode. That is so greedy. Dark mode is a basic requirement in 2019. Charging for different themes is understandable but for dark mode? Edit: i have uninstalled your app for the moment. Thank you for your consideration. I'll change my ratings from 1 to 3 for now.
"Actually a great app, I'm migrating from Wunderlist, and I love the option to add tasks from other lists to ""My Day"" and focus on just those. The 3 stars are from glitches that I'm experiencing, that just make it troublesome for smooth working. First is the ""from today"" tray that keeps coming up endlessly, needing me to force quit the app, only to have it happen repeatedly. Secondly the widget that doesn't update either tasks I've added, or tasks I've marked as completed in the app."
"updated review; left review here for wrong app. Not bad so far, migration of data off wunderlist mixed up all the items in the list, sorted by date, not within each list. not necessarily the apps fault. just challenging just to get started. already deleted two other apps that were worse."
I really like the sophisticated display and the level of personalisation you can make. It would get 5 stars...but....the default text colour for the month display widget is a dark grey that is too dark to read when using the dark theme. I have to go through every entry to change them individually to a light grey so I can actually read it in the widget. Any help?
Relaxing after the use
"Why on earth would you create an app that doesn't link with your calendar??? The To Do app is straightforward on Android app and desktop version. HOWEVER, there's no way to link it to Microsoft 365 Calendar! It's within the same suite of Microsoft 365 and yet, you can't schedule on either one to show up on the other. That's asinine! ! You would think this would be a primary feature, but the Product Manager must be sleep at the wheel. It's mystifying."
Best!
Can't complete events. Must keep dismissing it or delete it.
Reminders are a premium feature? Are you kidding me? This is an absolute deal breaker. I deleted after trying for 2 minutes.
"The My List feature is useful; the sharing and integrations, not for me. It really bugs me that there is no option to use my own photos. The few backgrounds and colors offered are unattractive. Going back to Wunderlist, the way I had it set up, is a pleasure. We shouldn't have to give up aesthetics when it's an easy fix. Widget has no options, either."
"I've played games all my life and found using this task-reward system, something I can relate too. It helped me structure my life so I can get the most productive and happy moments out of it, with the ability to add and takeaway tasks that are not so healthy or important at that time. Just remember you choose your path, so just take it a day at a time and keep working at."
its alright does same as google maps
"I used a Franklin Planner, this is a great alternative to going the digital route. This is used daily for me in taking notes troughout the day and setting up tasks that need completed."
"I don't want make an account before trying out the app! Give us a week trial before making us sign up, please."
"Looks a lot like todoist. I said ""look"" because todoist is bug free when compared to this one. What a waste of time I had trying to set it up both by natural language and clicking..."
"Very long time user. Latest updates are making things harder. Subtasks in recurring parent tasks are now automatically archived when completed and don't seem to reappear when parent task is due again. Example: I have a weekly todo titled ""Groceries"" with grocery items I need to buy as subtasks within that recurring parent task. Whereas before I could mark a subtask as complete and expect that same subtask to reappear next time when I go shopping again, it's now completely gone."
I really like the app. Maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more
Monthly widget needs to be premium:(
Worked fab until recently then I noticed the time in the centre was an hour wrong although when I went into the app it had the time right. So I uninstalled and tried to reinstall but when I tried to put the widget on my home screen it now puts on a blank box that's resizable but invisible otherwise! Very disappointed.
Awesome 👌😎 Great 👌😎 Useful Very nice and also the best app
Please give us more background pictures . Overall this app is better than any To-Do list app present in play store.
I don't like to put on google calendar every schedule
"Please help me after update when i try to unlock plants then app automatically get closed. Saying ""forest stopped working"" of you fix these problem then i will change my review please fix this bugs"
Excellent
I really like the app. Maybe just work on improving the graphs a bit more
"Good, free coral"
How modifying list items is done?
"My phone is a Samsung S8+. The introduction screen is mostly blank, and the character customization seems to be broken because your character and customization options don't show up. I didnt go any further."
Excelente aplicação. Boa integração com Google Calendar e facilita a Gestão do dia e da semana. Parabéns aos desenvolvedores.
"App is great, but it gets really annoying when the notifications don't ring and when the FAQs are only written for very few phones."
"Ehh it does it's job, but it's a bit confusing."
"Used to be good, but recently it shows full screen ads which cannot be turned off"
"Very good app. The synchronization with outlook is not always happening, somehow, but it is generally very reliable."
":( i cant log in after because i need to add a username. i did it, but the app froze when i was adding my username and now it seems is taken... when it wasn't. i tried again with a different one and happened again :("
It doesn't run on oneplus 7t Pro
"I liked its features. These are well thought through. If I could go back in 
timeline, it would have been better."
Nice but am looking for something that can synchronize with Google Tasks
I feel good while exploring this app
Timer not working when screen locked.
Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. 😕. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless
"The app would be nice and work well if it wasnt for this 1 issue but its a pretty big issue as far as daily planners go...It only shows half of a clock or calender in the create event/task subscreen meaning i can not select any times that would fall on the right hand side of the clock or I can not select a ""due by"" date  for tasks because the right side of the calender is missing...I would already own the full version if it wasnt for this problem"
Updated and now no longer sends the task again set to daily if you dismiss the notification.
not worth it if you can't go pro
"Absolutely liked it, ease of use and keeps list sorted."
i think you need to improve the ui... and the ui names. its really confusing.
"The layout was horrible, the events and the scheduled items don't sync."
"Very good but don't see why 1 would pay when Google has Google keep , and calendar works about the Same and is free"
User friendly. Great GUI. No bugs so far. Great app.
"I paid for premium, then followed (twice) every single instruction in the FAQ section regarding how to sync data between devices. Syncing did not work. I wasted 2 hours of my day trying to get this app to work."
Good
I cant download this app.it is really frustraiting
"This app is good, however the reason I need a calendar app is to share it with someone else, and this app doesn't seem to have a shared calendar function. Which is a shame because it's a really decent app."
Amazing app. Really motivating with an online support team. But so long as its online only its hard to depend on it.
"Thanks for your quick correspondence. I understand how the application's progress is limited due to resources, and hope that this will improve for all involved with time. I know times are tough for many worldwide, which means funding, now more than before, is harder to come by. All the best. Cheers."
"App idea and design is great, but it is not possible to add calendar from Work Profile account anyhow - it is just invisible. Android 7.1.1.   Promise rating 5, if fixed.  Upd: thanks for prompt reply, but it is about Google Calendar in Work Profile - it creates a separate copies of Google Apps for it. Please have a look at work profile specifics for Android 7+"
"Love this app! However I have one request. I want to be able to set a tag before I plant a tree, otherwise I have to update it all the time after the tree has grown. I'm not sure if there's already a way to do this."
"Don't like it very much, but I think it's just not for me. It's very complex and deep with tasks and such (I could even set the percentage of fear for a task... What??) so I didn't get very far before I just said ""forget it"". My life is too busy for such complexity."
"Doesn't seem to work on OP 6T, can go through character creation, but doesnt let me customize or select anything. half of the UI shows up blank."
I've used this app for years. It works great with Google Calandar and is continually updated and improved by the developer.
I love this app. I would really love an option to check off or mark that a task was complete.
Doesn't let you choose specific calendar events to ignore. No way to track how you actually spent your time if it didn't match your calendar
It works well for me with constant task reminders throughout the busy day for my business.👍🏽
"The best Todo list app I have come across!! I was able to move over my previous lists from wunderlist which made it so easy to set up and the ability to add subtasks and really easily move around and organise tasks is so helpful. The widgets are also really clean and customisable, no complaints!!"
Timestamp not available on to do list. I will now search for another app that can do that
"such a bad app,i try to click the log in button but it doesn't work,i exit from the app and i try again because i thought my phone was error but it still doesn't work..i uninstall the app and i reinstall again..the same things happened 😩"
the app keeps crashing whenever I click something. was going to sign in with google but it just wont work and turns out nothing's working it just keeps crashing everytime I try. I hope it gets fixed. I'm really looking forward to using this app.
Sometimes quits as it starts
"I'd be fine with paying $10 or $20 for this app. I'm not fine with paying $3 a month forever to continue using it. Without being able to use reminders on the free version, it's no more useful than a $5 pocket calendar, and I'm not willing to pay what they're asking."
"I like it a lot until you have overlapping times for your schedule or events.... It's too hard to tell which one you are looking at cuz it only shows one. Unless you touch it or open it but that defeats the purpose of it, it's for a quick glance. Fix that n ur golden."
Helping schedule my life
yeah!🤩
I didn't like the way the lists would set up...
I love having a fully customizable checklist widget.
"Trying to instill better habits in my life. This app has been such a big help, very methodogic and gives me daily reminders to log before I go to bed."
it works great for me but my friends are dealing with the days not reseting and aren't able to deal damage our monster....please i cant do this alone. our party needs help.
I found this app difficult to use. That's just my personal opinion. I uninstalled it and got a different one that is easier to use.
"This app is so helpful 😊 It helps me keep the different facets of my to-do list organized: house, yard, personal, work, health, and hobbies. You can create sub lists for each item as well. It alerts me when I should be doing something (I usually end up snoozing...shhhh), and I can make the tasks repeat. Thank you so much for this!"
"Overall i like this app, but i use it to make appointments, and it is very annoying that it won't link the name with the phone number frim the contacts automatically. You can do it manually, but it would be way quicker if it would link it automatically."
Doesn't look like the pictures at all. Exact same layout as your phone's calendar. Now new settings etc. Waste of time app.
"Used this app for years, but I can not tolerate the recent full page video ads that pop up after every calendar entry. I use the free version which I know is sponsored by Ad, the recent updates allow intrusive , excess ads that you can even skip and I can't renter the app to verify my calendar entry was added/modified corrected. The developer or owner has really overstepped with the recent updates and ads. I'm going back to the free Google app instead. I hope you push out a new update before y"
"Really amazing, but there are pop-up adverts if you're not a member, and for someone like me that's quite a few adverts daily. Very annoying!, But everything else is PERFECT. FYI The designers have to eat so I'm not mad but God damn that's annoying Would be really cool if you could at least watch a bunch of adverts at once so you don't have to do it later. Just an idea id be up for."
Good
Hey! The app is great but can't deal with the constant glitches and crashes. Cheers!
sir i already did all step but i still face notification ringing problem.
"On the widget, Calendar tab not functioning although inside the app already linked my Google calendar."
Too complicated and time consuming to set a task. No way to repeat on a monthly basis and specific day of the week at the same time. Not worth the time it takes to use it. Uninstalling.
It's good but the wall is pretty simple and can be more made more interesting.
I have an issue with the REPETITION function. Sometimes it doesn't appear. I'm using the paid version .
"New update has lost the ability to click on the widget and open the list full screen. The font is smaller, and ticking off an item on the widget has became more difficult. Please fix, five stars otherwise."
good
"This app is good, however the reason I need a calendar app is to share it with someone else, and this app doesn't seem to have a shared calendar function. Which is a shame because it's a really decent app."
"Recent addition of VERY intrusive full-screen video ads has crossed a line. At first I thought my phone had been hacked! I totally understand need for revenue for a great free app, but this is too much. I'm going elsewhere very soon without a change!"
Still love this app. It is the best calender app I have found. Also syncs to all devices. Thanks for your great service. Christine Reed 2020-Still love this calender! Use it everday for everything personal & professional. Couldn't get thru the day or nighr without it!!!!
"Hey dev, please bring back old UI in quick add widget... This new update does not have faster and efficient adding task event... Old version was perfect.... Please i have been using anydo since 4 years.... Please don't spoil it.."
"I never thought I could switch to a digital planner and yet here I am, my husband is so happy to see everything that used to take him time sifting through my calendar. We're all synced up on Google calendar now and i have the beautiful version for me to see on Artful Agenda with the lists I need to run my box and family!"
Couldn't get the rest of my calendars to appear. Feedback help wasn't clear as well. Uninstalling
"Exactly what I've been looking for to manage my personal projects and to do lists. After trying out the free version, I upgraded to paid immediately. It's just the right price with easy-to-use features on mobile and web versions. Not sure how managing team software projects would work on it--we're satisfied with Jira and Rally for those."
It igood
"Nice widgets and user interface. I really wanted to use this app for the Moments daily review, but ALL lists are included in the daily review with no option to hide lists. This made the Moments feature feel clunky and unusable."
Looks promising but I can't create avatar due to this error: path 'profile name' is required.
"updated review; left review here for wrong app. Not bad so far, migration of data off wunderlist mixed up all the items in the list, sorted by date, not within each list. not necessarily the apps fault. just challenging just to get started. already deleted two other apps that were worse."
It seems the app is not build for longer and more complex use. It looks like it can be used for people that plan to follow and develop their behaviour but the level of this app is of a game. Takes too long for resolving the bugs and no reaction to feedback. App crashes when using the calendar options. This should not happend when using payed version of the app. Waiting for improvement or giving up using and paying for this app.
"There seems to be no way to actually mark a task as complete, so I had to delete the tasks I actually did complete and therefore have not gotten in-game rewards. There is also no way at all to contact support. If you join the Habitat Help Guild that is supposed to allow you to ask questions, there is no obvious way to post a question there. There is a button to leave the guild but not one to post a question. This app is terrible and is a waste of time."
"I'm shocked and disappointed to see that suddenly my records from the past few days were gone, it was okay last night but when I opened the app, my trees were gone. I availed the premium version of this app, but I didn't see this errors coming. Please let me understand why it happened."
"Some nice features here. Their approach really set it apart from the other I've tried so far. It's a strong contender as a Wunderlist replacement. The only reason I am still not confident on a switch is their Wear integration. It's terrible! The app doesn't listen to the watch at all. I've tried completing and snoozing and it does nothing. The watch app can only add tasks, so the screenshots they're sharing here are DECEPTIVE. I also wish I could hide completed task, instead of deleting."
This is the best app for planning
Amazing app for improving productivity
"We are missing a chat feature AND notification when a task is changed / completed / modified in shared lists. Any.do is pretty good for my personal use but even though we are both premium, we don't see any possibility of interaction with the - kind of interaction Wunderlist provides not just tiny notification WITHIN the app."
The app is crashing nd getting stuck
This used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already. Unfortunately they introduced intrusive full-screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version. I'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that.
"I tried this out on a whim, thinking it was just another todo app that's been done a thousand times over. So far I'm finding it really simple to create lists and track tasks, which, as a result, actually has had a great impact on my mental stress by being able to organise my tasks and ideas in one user friendly place. I'm super happy that the mobile app syncs with the desktop app so that I can add things via my phone, forget about them, and action them when I'm at my PC the next day"
"LOVE this app! As a person with ADD, I find this app indispensable in keeping my ""out of sight, out of mind"" tasks in mind. It's clean, easy to use and configure, and the alarm sound is lovely. One further question - does this app have an iOs version for my iPad??"
How can I change the language??
"I have to uninstalled this app on my phone soon i open the apps and trying to make things to do list.. it worked fine just i have trypophobia and those small circles/dot just freaking me out... edit, the small circles/dots that i mean here is when i click new list next we fill the LIST NAME and it appears with small circles/dots in color for me who's having this kind of phobia that kind of design is just scary.. aside of that your apps seems to be simple and easy to use."
Great app for organizing To Do lists. Allows task lists under each item for more detailed planning Even has a Project section for more high level planning. Very user friendly. No ads.
"It doesnt seem to be possible to delete a single event in a series. So if I want to block off an hour every day for the same thing, but then I have to schedule a one-off thing during that time, I can't just delete one occurence and leave the rest of the future occurences alone. I love the app otherwise but this problem is pushing me toward a different app."
"Notifications are annoying and not customizable (was getting them for not having any tasks for the day). I turned off notifications via my android settings and am still getting impossible to turn off pop up notification that blocks whatever app I am on. App is fine otherwise, but not for me."
"One or two more inserting option to be given with basic arithmatic calculations to find quality of a habit. For ex. No. Of repititions divided by total time taken etc (ex. no. of something finished divided by total time taken, will give the quality)"
it is useful but not the perfect
"Came highly recommended. Tried it. HATE that I can't see the subtasks in a project(why even..), and apparently that's a recent update! Well no one seems to like this feature, or at least there should be an option to either have subtasks or not, so hope you guys bring it back. Will use it then. Another observation- most of the top-notch features are unavailable to non-Premium users, and not many are willing to subscribe. Seems a bit unfair. One time payment would be great. Will that change?"
"Like many others, the new big update has severely hindered my ability to use the app effectively. What used to be simple is now cumbersome with a 3x increase in the number of clicks to accomplish simple tasks. It wasn't broken, why did you have to 'fix' it. I'm hoping they roll back some of these changes, if they don't I will probably need to look elsewhere for a todo app."
After updating ..the app is crashing ..its not working
Awsome app
"App is getting more and more annoying. Additional features are forced on you and it lost a lot of its original functionality, which was why I bought it. Most probably I won't renew my subscription."
I really like this app I find the the way it presents the data in a clock face with countdowns to your EVENTS very useful. The one drawback for me is that it doesn't integrate with Google Tasks or Reminders. This means that everything you want to see needs to be created as an event. This is not a massive deal but I do like the convenience of tasks over events. The widget sometimes loses synchronisation with the clock and shows a different time than the actual time.
"The best time management app 3 years using it and it keeps me organised,efficient and productive."
"Exactly what I've been looking for to manage my personal projects and to do lists. After trying out the free version, I upgraded to paid immediately. It's just the right price with easy-to-use features on mobile and web versions. Not sure how managing team software projects would work on it--we're satisfied with Jira and Rally for those."
"Use this app every day and used to totally love it. But in the last month or so they have allowed full-page video ads to take over the screen. The only way to get rid of them is to force close the app, which I now do repeatedly. Can't continue like this! Totally unacceptable. What the heck could they possibly have been thinking. Downright stupid business decision. Looking hard for another app to replace this one as soon as I can. It was nice while it lasted."
"At first, i really loved it, it was helpful. Not until i lost my coins. It would prolly be great if u can at least log in to save ur earned coins, but if u try to log in, a payment will pop out.. Uninstalling this now and will try another app. So sad i had to say good bye to this app. Its so cute but its so stingy.."
"Excellent app. Does everything you want a habit tracking app to do. Only complaint is the app counts the current day in your progress with no option to change that. So it looks like you are less successful than you really have been on a daily activity done near the end of each day. For example, if I am tracking going to the gym after work everyday and have been successful for 2 weeks, the app will show me as less than 100% successful until I indicate today is successful. Need to fix that."
"Viewing the sub-project tasks inside the main project was an integral feature of the app that I used daily. Removing this without warning as if it were an 'improvement' is unacceptable and makes the app borderline useless for me, and as such I will begin looking for another app that can better suit my needs. Removing features and making pointless changes is no way to retain users."
"Would have been a five star had something as simple as a color theme change not came with a price. Seriously?! I have to pay premium prices just to go into dark mode. If I was going to pay, I'm most certainly not paying now. That's just too petty a thing. However, great concept guys."
Very easy to use 😄😃
Could be easier to set up and save notes. Was confusing at first but a good app
easy to use
"App is unable to manage Recurring Tasks. App has almost everything, but it fails on managing recurring task. After setting the task to be of Repeat type, marking task Completed for a specific day is marking entire task as completed..!!! And for this only reason, I had to uninstall. Please make necessary changes and inform."
I like the concept but the app itself is confusing to navigate and set up and is not very user-friendly.
"Really good app for organizing your daily routines, definitely worth getting. Wish simultaneous activities were better displayed, though!"
Does not allow tracking of more than 5 habits without upgrading. Unable to remove or hide features that are of no use to me. Do not recommend. Waste of time.
Como que eu configuro uma tarefa para ser realizada todas as terças e quartas? Se não é possível fazer isso adicionando apenas uma tarefa precisa melhorar urgentemente
"Getting into it, following the mechanics and I feel motivated to do ans comolete stuff to earn Exp. I haven't used it much but I'm satisfied already. One small thing I can't choose to wear no glasses and I believe this is an unintentional error."
"Paid for premium so I could sync between devices, but it doesn't work and customer service will not respond to my inquiries."
Love it keeps me organised
Reminders seems to be acting up. It's currently just popping up some reminders and not even doing others.
"I just started using this. One thing I would like to see is the ability to add check boxes to an event. For example I have a time slot labeled housework scheduled from 11am to 12pm. I would like to be able to tap on that block of time and see that I need to do dishes, vaccume, and dust in that time frame, and be able to mark off each task as it is complete."
It is not running in my phone...
Super fun way to keep up with tasks
One of my favourite!
The integration with Google assistant works very well
I can't use it after updating this app that's the drawback of the app otherwise it's quite good
I loved this app until the latest update. Full screen ads that you can't cancel are just too annoying. I'm outa here..
Excellent
I don't rent apps. I will pay a price to use it but Walmart doesn't charge by the month or year for pants. Yes I would prefer ads.
Good
อยากให้มีจับเวลาไปเรื่อยๆได้ หยุดอ่านตอนไหนค่อยหยุดเพราะบางครั้งก็ไม่สามารถกำหนดเวลาอ่านได้แต่อยากรู้ว่าอ่านไปกี่ชั่วโมงแล้ว
Without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless. Love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one I've seen that doesn't sync anywhere between devices.
It was really helpful to keep track of what I have to do everyday. I think that it is easy to use and it could be even better one day
I love this app beacuse it's so simple to use. It's also easy to follow the schedules that you plan in the app.
"Paid for it, it's alright if you don't use the widget. Constantly freezes and needs refreshing."
"Bought the pro version, amount got deducted and programer version became accessible. But after sometime its showing that i have to buy the pro version again. Kindly troubleshoot this problem."
I wish i can use hand writing
"Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete"
"It's for me really useful, but I have a problem with the new species of trees, because when I try to unlock a new tree, it closes"
Nice experience .this app more valuable in my study timing concetration.
You need internet access and the server has to be up on their side for you to be able to access your to-do list. Server has been down today and I cant check off or edit my to-do list due to that. Going to be deleting this app. Most other to-do lists work offline.
"Too much ads in the free version. Impossible to stop to watch it until the end, i'm not the first to strongly condamn it, you reply you are trying to fix it, but you set it !!! Should be less aggressive, and may be more users customers. I waited few months you react and correct it. ==> personaly i'm unstalling it"
A very cool program. We want Arabic.
"A few major issues: 1. The addition of sections in projects is nice, but not useful if they only appear in project view but not filters. 2. The sections cannot be reordered to appear at the top of a list, the can only be at the end of a task list. 3. In filtered view, pulling subtasks out of their parent task or non-completable tasks is ludicrous. Duplicating them like that is silly at best."
"I like the app but the only thing which i personally wanted was, if i were able to share picture with my shared tasks people, lets say i make a task to pay bill with my husband but i want to send him the image of the bill. Other than that better from other apps"
"Great App to maintain all category task, you can categorise it to personal, work and many more and it can sync to all device where you have logged in using same account. It replaced my physical book to maintain to do list. And it is available to me on the go as well."
I need to pay just to use reminder damn never using this app again so money hungry.
Love this app. Very user friendly and easy to link schedule with other devices.
"The app itself is very good.  Nevertheless, there's a problem: I can't seem to make it work on my Sony Smartwatch 3.  In fact, as soon as I install the app on my phone, the watch face appears on the watch but after a while (about a minute) it suddenly disappears."
"I enjoy using this app, it makes habit tracking fun and entertaining.."
Can add a reminder option withthe specified time
"Even though I am having problems with notifucations, causing me to reset, this app is amazing as it is so easy to use and it aesthetic. I love this app because it is so easy to change your timetable according to the easily changing life we live."
"Annoying, slow, clunky, unresponsive, repetitive"
"The sound reminders are basic, should be on the free version. Price is absurd. Just gonna continue with tick tick."
"Uhhhh.... has anyone actually read the privacy policy? By accepting your allowingvthem access to your camera, audio, data usage, location, photo library, email,purchases, usernames, and they clearly state "" for third party"" in it...."
"Wonderful app! I'm just wondering if I overlooked something, because if, for instance, I set a habit to ""every 3 days"" but end up doing it every 2 days instead, the app is counting the 3rd day as a fail? Which seems very strange to me, since I actually did better than needed!"
"I can't get the widget to appear in the background wallpaper screen ,, 
purchased the app only for that feature ,,, any help ?"
"I have been using this app for about a year now without any issues, so I'm definitely not fond of the new routines menu. I find that swiping from side to side for the days to be much easier and having the drag and drop feature to be more comfortable (Hope it will be implemented again soon). Also the fact that you can't move a blank time frame up and down makes it difficult to set up the routine. As I have to change the time of every item to move it down. I would prefer the old version, hopefully it all gets fixed soon."
A fun and beautiful way to organize your life! I'm a huge fan!!!
"Hi to Microsoft team, Request # 1: To be able to print a list with only the items marked with an asterisk which are classified in alphabetical order. Request # 2: For all tasks (from all lists) marked with an asterisk and which are all grouped in the same place, these tasks should be displayed in alphabetical order under their respective list (and not grouped in a single list ). And also, have different options to print a single or, all lists (with sorting options). Thank you"
The premium version of the app is good....But the free version is useless.. And some school students don't get proper support paying monthly from their family of my country. Every interesting and useful feature arw in premium...
Simple and effective! although charging for color themes is ridiculous. I understand getting charged for the other add ons but color shouldn't be extra! The widgets are white and black see thru which makes it hard for me to see. little dots aren't helpful.
"hi, i am not able to use the paid version to full. Kindly help me. the help and feedback is not loading itself."
fun and easy
Totally useless - sharing lists does not work.
"On Xiaomi regular launcher does not allow resize, and update widget."
Good
I really like it. I think it's a really cool concept to have characters to build up with the habits. Only thing I wish were there is to be able to have notifications for term less habits
"To Do list cant be shown on widget. Only the myday can be, which i dont want to use. There are better options. microsoft refuses to use common sense agsin with this app. Your to do item needs to be less than about 15 words in order to view it. while editing the item you can write 50 words or more, but after saving you cant view it completely because the scroll doesnt function well enough. 75% of the screen real estate (like most microsoft sw) is wasted."
Love this app
"Setting things up can be a bit confusing but overall it's good. The notifications aren't working on my phone, and when setting the task to something that can be completed all day, I'd like to be able to set times for me to get notifications about it without having to do the weird ""give me a notification 12 hours before"" The whole point of me getting a to-do list app was to have not only a list, but reminders, so until the notifications work I'll have to resort to a different app."
"One of the best productivity apps on the Play Store. I had recently purchased the app to customize the widget and colors but find it difficult because it could not load the existing wallpaper I am using, on the preview. It is also hard to try and mix different colors to see. It would be best to have the customization be seen real time rather than pick and see color. Thank you."
"Game is great, can give back results where you put in effort. However when I last tried to put in a task everything was empty and I cant seem to log back in."
"Very nice app, has everything required for tracking habit. Please introduce option to change unlock pin."
"Edit: Thanks Forest team for fixing this bug! I give you back the 5 stars! Been using it for around two years, always liked it until a new update recently where it does not notify me anymore when the focus period ends. It would be better to put the feature back in to help users maintain mental energy sustainably."
Quick to learn and easy to use.
"Would be better if the Inbox was not treated as a project, but rather a scheduling location, and that items could be created in the inbox and EASILY (bulk) moved to other projects (but stay in the inbox) to then be scheduled to daily or next week or whatever Tracking would be easier. and the app would get a higher rating and I may actually subscribe.. Its a deal breaker for me."
I like the app. But why a habit is limited to once a day. There's no habit twice a day or more? I can't understand.
doesn't allow you to do a Samsung back up and restore
"Beautifully designed. Lacks the option to make tasks recurring, which would be very helpful."
It's awesome app
There's no search option for mobile version even I already have the latest version
Greatly improved comment from me.  MUCH better than a year ago.  Most updated lead to improvement.  Wish the ' want an annual subscription.
Awesome
Fantastic app but 4 stars. Every part has been a comfortable experience for me until I started trying to use it across devices. I took me around 30 minutes to set up all my tasks the first time and when I signed into my account for the app all the tasks I had made got overwritten by the default tasks from the other device. It was partially my fault for the careless order that I signed in on the devices. But perhaps my issue could have been avoided entirely if when it attempted to sync my tasks from the internet the first time it asked me if I wanted to use the database that is from the internet or that is local. Would have saved me a lot of headache remaking all the tasks again. That said every other function provided is great and I would recommend.
I love this app but from few days it is failing to open and asking to clear the history i am disappointed with that!
"This helps me to be so much more organized! Huge improvement over my random pieces of paper and lists all over the place. It's simple, fluid, and easy to use. (Written after one week of use.)"
I am managing need a reminder
"This app is a great way to manage the tasks I have to complete for school. However, I wish there is a way to distinguish which task are from which list, like on the website."
"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work."
"This is a very good app, but it doesn't quite meet my needs. I canceled my account, but they kept charging me for months. I finally got through to their customer service, and they refunded all my money. I have adjusted my review to reflect this. Otherwise, this app is well thought out and worth trying."
Very practical and usefull application
"It has very nice, useful and comfortable look, I used it with a pleasure. Unfortunately synchronization with gmail calendar stopped working. Tried to reinstall this app - it helped for a week and stopped working again."
"I am using only this app for all my tasks, reminders, duties etc cause I didn't find better one, but this one is not without flaws either. There are few different lists of your tasks (my day, planned, tasks, all) , and they are all intertwined, you can find one of your tasks in two lists, but you can also find it in one list and not in the other. This is so confusing. And there is an urgent need of calendar so you can clearly see all of your tasks for one month, for example."
"The app is constantly loading and you can't even record your habits, and reminders don't work also, having just 5 habits free is bad too."
Very good app for todos list and time management. I would say it is an all purpose app for those who are looking to organise their tasks in a time effective manner. Could not find any glitches. I would say it is the perfect app I have come so far..
I paid for premium account. But my account status is still free with no premium feature.
"Voting 1 star because it's the only way for developers to actually see this bug report: The widget doesn't have the Ding! completion sound. Making it nearly worthless, please fix!"
Ok
"There's no simple reminders or ability to add to do task, everything has to be added via calendar which is irritating me...app is useless right now"
This app is good but I can't access 5 habit because I need premium to access it 🙅🤷
"edit : something more important, please don't make the user logged out after using vpn, it's a pain to log in every time this app is great, but please add the copy list feature on android too, and also ""uncheck all"" feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one"
"I have been researching for a while a new to-do list that would replace my Wunderlist. I finally thought I found one, this felt perfect. It was user-friendly, colorful, allowed for notifications, reminders, etc. My biggest problem is that I can't share my lists with my hubby. I mainly use this for personal use, so I can totally understand that it would only allow for a certain # of people to share with, but... unfortunately no sharing at all. I am back on the hunt : ("
"It's hard to not get bored when I being serious on something. So, I always think that life is a game. And this is a great app that can help me to get rid from my boredom when I build my good habits. Thank you very much for the developer. 5 stars from me. 😊🤩"
"I like it okay, so far. But I'm flabbergasted at one behavior. I entered the task ""Do house clean this early evening"". Todoist DELETED the words ""this early evening"" and arbitrarily scheduled a time. I didn't want that. I tried to read-add the text, but it kept deleting it and scheduling the job for 7 pm. The only way I could have time information remain in the task name was to misspell it! I changed ""early evening"" to ""earli evening"". It worked, but it's ridiculous."
"Really easy to use, it even gives an overall success percentage to let you know how well you're smashing your goals! Highly recommended :)"
The new widget is not looking good. Please bring back the old widget or atleast bring an option to make it look like the older version.
I love that this app combines all of my various calendars (work and personal) to have a quick total view of my day(s). Such a timesaver!!!
I like how simple to use the app is. All basic functions that I need are covered in the basic version for free.
"It's a mess. I add new tasks and tag them. But they will randomly disappear, reappear. And the tags will disappear. Editing and adding them back in doesn't help because once a tag disappears you can't add it back in again. Disappearing tasks is the worst because there's no warning. They're just gone. They're not listed as complete, they just disappear. Sometimes they'll come back but sometimes I have to re-enter them...assuming I remember. I pay for this app, so the fact that the basic functionality of keeping my list intact is random and spotty is unacceptable. It may have something to do with syncing... no idea. But either way, I'm going to use another app because I just don't trust it anymore. These errors seem to be recent, like in the last 3 months."
"I love this app. It's like my own pocket-PA. I make notes on habits and when I go back to view, they're not in chronological order. They're ordering by the day of the month regardless of what the month is (DD/MM/YY) e.g. 03/07/2020 then 04/03/2020 then 05/06/2020. I'd change it to Y/M/D but can't see how to. I'll give 5 stars anyway because it is a great app despite this minor but annoying glitch. Is there any way to edit the habits, such as to change the days? I can't find a way to do that."
"I'm a pro user, worked great initially but it is not opening and continuously stopping. Please fix this asap."
Haven't tried it yet...
"i ws kinda disappointed because i really loved the user interface of the app and how smooth it flows from one set up to another. however, i have to uninstall and install it back up several time because it will not accept the 4digit password i have set it up with. i had to do it like 10 times :/ but still like the app tho. i hope that bug will be fixed sooner."
Good app. No lags. Does what it says. I'm happy.
Nice layout
"Only just discovered there's a bit of a, sub didn't make that clear before sign up no chance its a cheek doing it sneekly you should be ashamed deleted"
New version causing freezes and crashes. :-(
I love this app but it's crashing very frequently and it's very annoying.
"I do understand ""free"" means accepting advertising, but your recent ads are horrible, cannot be shorten, and sometimes embarrassing. I uninstall now. Left you two stars for old times sake. *Added after Dev response. It wasn't the frequency. It was the advert that was served. I think it was some kind of Japanese pornstar (not sure cuz I was busily trying to close it, to no avail). I was in meeting with Client, checking next date, and the unstoppable advert happened. Simply cannot risk this again"
"I downloaded this app on my tablet long time ago (full version) and recently also downloaded it on my phone as I don't bring my tablet with me all the time. I only use the ""task"" function, because  my  calendar events do not sync properly (I haven't fpnd the sync button on my phone...) and another not so funny thing for me: I am using the same account for both devices, BUT I can't use the full version on my phone (I get a message that I need to buy it (???)...) that's why I need to use my tablet (with the full version on it) if I want to add something."
Pros: Intuitive design Great way to acheive goals Cons: Not entirely free It works with google calendar but each task only can be in 1 hr intervals
"It's a good app but it doesn't really work for me. Please provide an offline mode, because not everyone has data and Wi-Fi throughout the whole day. I will rate it 5 stars once there is an offline mode."
"Amazing app to help you complete focused work without falling into distractions. You plant virtual trees and get coins when they grow up. You can accumulate the coins and exchange them for either new types of virtual trees or to plant ACTUAL ones. So, not only it helps you in being more productive. But also, it lets you contribute to the environment."
Easy to use really and the integration with google calendar is awesome.
"Widget seriously needs fixing. Screen real estate is important, and your widget is huge & wastes so much space. Please set up options for controlling text size in it & try to remove dead space, & the title of the app, since it's unnecessary. This is almost a deal breaker for me. :( Also, small request, is there any way you can change the task example to anything but the name Alex? Like ""someone"" instead, because honestly it triggers me pretty bad (abuser). Thanks for considering my comments."
"Just what I've been searching for. I like the compact view of the routines and tasks, and the satisfying way to mark them completed or not. The sorting options are useful. It would be great if you could add automatic syncing to gdrive at some point."
"The app is simple & clean. Tracks Habits efficiently. The only reason I am giving 4 star is because Reminder notifications aren't working properly. Habit Tracker, please fix it!"
It was good until they introduced long adverts every time you add an entry.... How to annoy your users ! I won't be forced to pay... I have given good feedback in the past and good feedback encourages others to pay now you have decided to make the free version really annoying to use you are creating bad feedback! Good luck
Simple and to the point
"Overall, it was good. But I set a Todoist widget, and now I can't get rid of it. It just stays in my homescreen, and I can't delete it. It covers my apps too. When I press it, it doesn't respond, and just stays there like a glitch. It brought alot of difficulty to me. And even after I delete the app, it still stays! And the widget's reminders aren't even mine! I think it's an example for the new Todoist app users. Plesse help me to do something about it."
"Been a paid member for years. They've been completely frozen in time, features people have begged for years have been ignored or if they do it takes them years to implement. Had to wait years just for dark mode. I saw a blog post on their site where the project manager boasts about travelling full time in his car with his family, explains a lot really.    They've really let their (once) loyal users down. Hopefully another app comes along and eats their lunch because it's there for the taking."
"I love the widgets for this app but there are some synching quirks that drive me nuts ?!!? Not sure if it's the app or the stock Google calendar but whichever it is, it's not a good combination !"
Wouldn't even let me customize.
Nice app.but store is not opening. I am unable to unlock new plants . fix the problem please.
"Very good app, simple but enough to use, I'm going to get pro. But a question, sync with google calendar, is 1 way sync (only can review), or 2 way sync?"
Great application 👍
"Bug that says 'path 'type' is required' everytime I try to do something. I tried submittinf an error report through menu - about - report a bug, but I get the same error message when I try report the bug"
"Would like to assign priority rating to each task (A=do it soon, B=do it later, C=low priority, Z=take it off the list)"
Limited free goals.
"This is app is perfect just need a checklist and daily, weekly and monthly tracker for each task... Had it been have all these, I would have given all 5 stars! You know sometimes we miss(or intentionally ignore) reminders and we need trackers for those for self development!"
Poor interface.
Got it for he to know do of do not do me to my do do an do gone by hi do you do of do is well your name is on the list for the next few days and I will be there at the same time I don't have a whole lot of time to get the kids to the gum Wall Street journal and send it to you when I get home I will send you the link to the video of the puzzle in my room you have for me to get the kids to the gum Wall Street journal and send it to you when I get home I will send you the link to the video of 🤩🤩
I have the premium version. I had been using Wunderlist. The most amazing Todo app ever and very intuitive. Tick Tick has worked well as Wunderlist is no longer supported. However some key things I truly miss. Push notifications when someone texts within the app. Notification that someone else has updated or completed a task or list. Copy and paste everything I need into a section as a single item in the list instead of everything becoming its own item in a list.
Would have been better if sticky notes feature was added to it. But love this app.
The app worked fine for awhile but all the events I added were simply gone this morning. This was a frustrating experience.
Everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
"Used it on & off for years. Motivational but not annoying like some. Nice design, various views (week, month, specific habit progress). Wide variety of goal options such as doing something x amount of times a week or every x day of the week or month. ALL the stats. You can set a date to achieve the goal (app recommends like 60 I think). Discussion boards. Other features as well, I just don't use them much. All in all, great app."
"I thought I'd like it. I like it more than I thought I would. Seeing appointments and meetings on a clock face is extremely intuitive, and having a widget that can show it on the home screen is a real boon. Fully recommended."
"I write only 7goals,because The program did not accept. I like this app🤔🤔"
Easy n accurate....user friendly app. Voice to text funtion is also very helpful.
Good app but in free version they should add more features just like reminder with time duration. I like it's feature of description in which we can add sub task and tick then.
"NOT a fan of the new permission requirements. I've never had any problem with the app detecting whether I've left it, and shouldn't have to give you access to my notifications for the app to do the same job as always. Right now it's basically just a fancy timer. EDIT AS RESPONSE: I get that, but was it really necessary to make that mandatory for anyone, even users who had no problem before? Regarding data use, the only thing I can do is take your word for it (as with any company, but still)."
"This app is exactly what i want. Very satisfied with this app.A lot of colour options and can create lists and sub-lists. Easy and nice, user friendly. It will be better if i can copy task to a new task."
"It's not syncing right with my gmail. My recurring events are all messed up but, are right on my gmail..... Deciding whether to keep it or not."
"Been using for a little over a week and I really enjoy this experience. Traditional to-do list functionality combined with a habit tracker and pomodoro timer really hits all the marks I need from a productivity app. My only complaints are the lack of certain functionality for the Mac app, but on Android you're knocking it out of the park."
"The app itself gets the job done, but it will not sync and the developer is not responsive to questions. Don't waste your money with premium. You won't get what you pay for."
Very useful and encourages motivation
"Great app. Could suggest rewards that fit the task type, offer actual customer / icon customization, and allow linkage of tasks to overarching goals that have separate rewards attached. Other than that - best app like this I can find - a lot of great features."
The app does not support various calanders from outlook
Too complicated when putting on data. I'll stay with my diary.
"The free version was great until now, but since they added advertisements to it (e. g. forced to watch an ad after creating an appointment) I cannot recommend it anymore, it is absolutely annoying, the Google calendar is the better alternative now."
I've been asking the developers of this app for YEARS to add the ability for the user CHANGE THE TEXT COLOR of the day numbers in month view. The current gray color doesn't offer enough contrast when using dark themes. We also need the ability to add clearly visible grid lines surrounding the day cells in month view. Two very simple requests that go ignored year after year after year.
It's a good app but needs internet connection all the time for reminder. If only it was offline.
Excellent
"Please check fast.. This app is not working properly.. When I open the Store for taking another tree, then the app exit.. I reinstall But again it shows the same problem..."
"This is a great app, very intuitive and easy to use. My only complaint is that when opening from the widget it always owns into week view and doesn't remember that I have set month view as my preferred. Still, everything else is brilliant, so definitely deserves 5 stars."
I liked this app....also the way it has organised and even it helps a lot ...not only in study also in other work and i like this appp....happy to install it..... ☺☺☺☺....
"Bad experience as the events created (Ex: Birthdays, Anniversaries, etc.) in Alarm mode is working only sometimes!! In such situations, the event is just turning ""Red"" (but Alarm is not ringing) as if i missed the event...!!"
"Liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting, but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks. That's a deal -breaker for me. I'm uninstalling"
"Sir your app is so great, its alarm to remind you about schedule is great and timer..i wonder you can add the timer feature to count the no of hours you study during a day etc..like that"
"It is a good idea, but it's not really easy to use.. in fact it's quite complicated :/ I bought premium because they advertised I could set schedules per day, and I can, but not how I had hoped. I recommend to make it simpler by allowing the user to toggle days per schedule in the routine editor, and additionally make any small changes in each individual day."
"I love that all my calendars are integrated in one spot, work, school, kids, small business. its pretty, functional, tracks meals, to dos and water intake. I'm thrilled to have something pretty to add joy to my day. Thanks Beta Team!"
"was loving this app originally, did everything i wanted. Calendar, reminders, lists, habits. Easy to use..... until latest Android upgrade, no longer receiving any reminders. Disappointed, tried everything and the app just doesn't work. Will unfortunately be cancelling my subscription."
"Avoid. Avoid. Avoid. Even in the paid app, we are just given 2 trees, and the rest again have to be purchased. And they are not by any means inexpensive. Then there are the ads. Ads for their other apps that popup constantly. Why should I get ads when I have paid. Avoid!"
"Love the app and the features. But it is still missing a lot. Automatic adding of tasks to ""My Day"" based on date; being able to set a start and end date and/or occurances for repeat tasks, customisations for subtasks, being able to choose specific dates for a repeat task amongst others."
"Reminders only pop up when I remember to open the app, which defeats the whole purpose. If the reminders popped up automatically at the set times, I'd give the app 5 stars."
"Great idea and I'm enjoying it so far. Chores and errands are much more fun. My one gripe so far is that it seems like most items/quests cost gems, which are pay to play. I'm afraid i'll pretty quickly run out of free items/quests to strive for and then the app will lose its effectiveness. It'd be helpful if their were other ways to unlock gems outside of paying for them, like reaching extra high levels of productivity/habit building, etc."
"BULL: I've been using it for 2 weeks and it's okay, except for the fact that the widget doesn't work most of the time. I have to open the app directly to be able to list activities, which renders the widget useless. I paid for the upgrade which makes this issue all the more frustrating!"
Très pratique !
"Dont work, the best it got was the vibration notification worked. I can't get any sound at all from this app."
I love this app. I just wish that there was an internal calendar in it so that I didn't have to create and turn on a calendar in Google Calendars in order to receive alerts for events in Sectograph.
"Amazing app. This really really helps me to increase my productivity, and to keep a note of the things which I need to do. And thank you so much for the cross platform support, I can access my tasks over my pc or anywhere I want. This app solved several problems of mine"
"Tried this app for a bit. The logic is very different from what I need, so the experience wasn't good. This app focuses on routines and is built around this concept. It was very confusing at first (because it started with abstract ideas, not what average joe is already familiar with; e.g. calendar/timeline) and the entire experience just felt awkward. For me, all I want is, see the day/week/month, add to-do items one by one, and be able to turn any of these items into routines when I want to."
What used to be simple has become tedious and barely functional. Wunderlist was to central part of the day. ToDo due dates and reminders are not aligned. Notifications seem to have died. Almost forgot I had a To Do list....
"I wish widget would have a very compact design, just a list of tasks, nothing more -- no menu bar, no headers, etc. As for me, the widget eats too much of homescreen space and is not optimised."
"It stops functioning after I restart my phone, I tried whitelisting it, but it does not help."
"just started using it, but so far so good"
This is super interesting
"Very good app, but it would be perfect if the app actually didn't shut down and not give me notifications. PLEASE FIX THIS"
não tem a opçāo de sub tarefa
"You can't set a location by name, only address. Yes I tried setting my location manually, like that would be at all useful. Do you even understand what I'm saying? I CANT TYPE IN LA FITNESS AND GET AN ADDRESS. It will just send me to whichever is closest. Setting my location wouldn't help, it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further... Worthless."
One of the best app to develop habits. The special thing is about this app is that it provides a medium to share the experience of other fellows who are also trying to develop the same habit.
Perfect
Good app
The majority of things are blocked off by subscription.
"stealing in 2020: make an app, call it HabitBull, make people buy it, remove it from playstore, republish the same app with a different name."
Nice
"I'm editing my review due to the new update. Dear todoist, the new update made it nontrivial to change the project of a task on the app. I have to click on the three dots then on move project. This should be as simple as changing the label. Please, be so kind to the users and fix this. .... Great app, does exactly what I need it to do. Extremely simplistic and elegant, yet functional design. I would tweak one little thing or too, but overall todoist is almost a perfect product."
This app is great. I was using different methods to change myself and they all failed but this RPG style game which I can even customize has proved to be most efficient.I would like the app developer to add some more stuff like new acheivements at different levels and getting access to more functions as we level up.😊(it will make app more interesting instead of getting more and more boring every time)
"I thought it was great, i had no problems at all and i have no complaints about the app at all. I havent experienced any of the difficulties that others have aparantly had. Thanks for this great app!"
"it is fun but now i just level up and i don't get any notifs for ""unallocated stat points"" anymore"
"Almost Perfect, an option to export Archived Habits (preferably to excel) would be Great.."
Good app to use. I've been bullet journaling by hand but moving back to digital and this was the best I found to transition. Early days but so far so good
This App sucks compared to Wunderlist.
"Full package for IDR 139000, got a 33% discount but still IDR 139000"
Helps me accomplish my tasks
Only certain Google calendar entries show in the sectograph making this absolutely pointless. A great idea that is flawed in execution.
"I downloaded this app today but there is a problem that makes me unable to see to-do lists,habits etc. I really want to use this app but I can't do it when I can't see the options. It would be great if you fixed it so I can use it!"
All I want is a calendar. This app spams you so much. 1 star
Really keeps things organized!!
"The app has been great on desktop and decent on the phone. Performance of the Android app is noticeably worse than iOS though, especially on start up."
Does not sync with Google Task List unless you pay 2.99/month or their annual rate. Quite disappointed since their beautiful platform does not meet minimum sync options of Google task lists. I only found out that u had to purchase a task sync option AFTER I connected to my Gmail account. Not cool at all b/c it felt like a misleading bait and switch and now solicitor that I have to block because I synced my email to attempt what it said that it was able to do. Sorry Tick Tick but 🚫⛔👎💃💨
"Need Wifi/Data for it. I get that you can play with your friends, but it would be nice if I could use it without wifi for data anyway. I have a limited ammout of data and brain memory. So by the time I get home after all day I've forgotten my habits and the point becomes mute. Only gave this an extra star because I love the 8 Bit art."
Good but the paid version did not work as I wanted to use it more so I was disappointed
"I had really begun to depend on this app and was having fun. Then I downloaded the update. I now have NOTHING. Not even the IMAGE of an avatar, there's just NOTHING THERE. I have no experience, no level, no coins, NOTHING. I was having a really awful day and this was just icing on the cake. There was so much I put into this game. How can I remember all of the tasks I scheduled for myself? I am so so discouraged."
Very bad experience with this app. This app works for only those user who are already subscriber to other apps or software of Microsoft. Password blocked and didn't let the password reset in the name of security
"Todoist is probably the best to do list app on the market! I had a lot of problems planning my time and tracking my tasks with a bunch of other apps and none of them worked. Don't have that problem with Todoist though. It's somehow the simplest app and yet has the most features I need. The premium version looks cool with a lot of useful bonus features, though I haven't tried it yet. The only thing I'd like for the app to have is recurring tasks in the pasts, so I hope they add it one day!"
Nicely....
"It is doing a strange black screen thing, and randomly opens by itself (other reviews have mentioned this) and I suspect it is making my phone crash. My phone is crashing several times a day, when I remove the app it stops crashing. I hope there is a fix for this. It works just fine on my tablet, but not my phone. It's a great app due to its simplicity. I switched to another planner app today and will be requesting a refund."
It's good app But it's not free if you want to add more than 5 habit
"It should have an option which gives no time range, and one can on and off the timer as per his requirement and accordingly trees are planted."
I bought the allegedly better version it worked for about a month. I had all my scheduled stuff about 6 months and all of a sudden the disappeared which sucks.
Only the premium version is good
"help me to organize my schedule in one stop need (calendar, tast, notes, etc) thanks Planner Pro!"
"It's really good. I dont want to have to pay for premium and I wish I could see the tasks I've completed, but at the same time it works really well for what I need it for."
"The only problem I have come across so far is, the day calendar does not change automatically. In order to get the current date on the day calendar is to go to the month calendar and select today's date. That said, the program and UI is better than the pre-installed calendar program."
"I've been using the paid version for several years now. The calendar is well designed and I enjoyed everything it can offer. Recently though, there are sync issues with my google calendar. I sometimes have to do it manually."

It's good but it's size is large
"Where do I start. I'm a paper planner addict, but I work in the Healthcare Field and can't bring all pens, stickers, and other paraphernalia. I cannot believe I can work on my schedule from my laptop and it immediately transfers to my phone. I'm floored. What a great thing, not to mention it's only going to get better as time goes! It gives me a bit of peace and calm to work on my planner during the day, thank you Kate!"
"The feature of customization for repeating calendar/event function has disappeared. When attempting to modify, it used to asked, ""Do you want to delete all calendar/event in the series or delete this particular function?"" Except for grandfathered calendar functions, the feature of attempting to delete a particular calendar function/event no longer exists."
Great app! but there is an error when I try to open the store to unlock new trees or songs it says (error: 664) I hope to fix that problem soon
"Better than previous tried apps, completely free with timely alarm for task deadline. Good"
i love this app so far but the notifications are not really working for me
"I do not have the premium version, but this app is great for helping me with my procrastination by setting goals with rewards, which in my case is decorating my forest, and helping me live up to them and not quit. It helps me set a goal at the start, and Ali's FINISH it and not get distracted or give up halfway."
This app would be so amazing if you add ' repeat weekly/2 weeks ' feature . We would then be able to use it as a time table ! Please 🙏
I think that feature of changing theme should be addef and apart from that there should also be a option for showing task on thr facr of calender itselg
"I am hating the experience now, this app was so great untill it started missing on my tasks reminders and its crazy i couldn't get a very important task done that i put a reminder to here, and i have allowed tick tick all the functions it needs but this reminder thing, its pissing me off, please get it fixed."
fun way to track habits. It would be great if you could update tasks without an interent connection and then just sync the next time your connected like many other trackers
"want to put a line through items but leave them visible. don't know how to manipulate to keep certain items from week to week, but cancel others. no instructions. but better than other apps that I've seen."
Those dots on the right of each item are gone. How do you reorder your to do items now?
"Keeps asking for a rating. OK, here's one."
It's just okay.
Great App... Keep up the good work
Hey the game crashes when I go to the store now
Started with Wunderlist years ago. This works just as well. The ability to share a list with my husband means we both always know what groceries are needed and there's no list to be forgotten at home!
"one of the best to-do apps on the market, great!"
Good
Still learning about it.
"I have 3 issues: 1) Habit gets ticked even if we touch it by accident. It would be better if there was option to press for some time in order to get habit ticked. 2) another feature required. If we have 10 habits to get done today, & we complete 7/10. Then it would show today's productivity as 70%. 3) there should be a feature to decrease the font size of habit. -- I would like to know if you have some product with this feature, then I am ready to purchase. If you could answer me this. Thanks"
It does not have the ending time of an event
Ok ok ok
Only issue I have encountered so far is that it doesn't seem to work for meetings that occur every two weeks. Works on the first reminder but then doesn't update to the next occurrence.
"299 lists, 999 tasks per list, and 199 subtasks per task, these not premium."
Doesn't show a files attached to the event using Google Calendar.
Looks cool but I do not find it actually helpful unless you write down everything you do every hour every day.
Excellent
It cannot work by itself and it's not user-friendly
Last updated 2018 really!!!! I am a premium user and it crashes sometimes. Bad investment.
Great apps for time management
"Too greedy on the premium features. I'm not going to pay monthly for the ability to add a description/comment to my task. Without this, you have a one liner for the task. There are tons of alternatives that do the same things as this app. I tried this one, the premium features don't interest me and the rest isn't worth a subscription."
I just downloaded it to see the continuity of work I do. I found it personally useful. 1st : I am reminded by the large display of tracking down my habit. which I wanted to continue. 2nd : Now I can read the comments I entered after finishing the tasks. Now it is becoming habit for me to keep track on my habits that i see improvement in overall doing. i hope i still achieve lot more through this app. I heartly thank to the developers and creators of this app. signing off.
I've used planner pro for 5 years or more now. Couldn't do without it.
"New to the app, but it looks very useful based on what I've seen thus far. I'm looking for an option we're saved routines can be implemented into the daily schedule, but are also tied to a kind of countdown timer that corresponds to the specific routine added (e.g., impromptu select ""laundry"" and it's automatically integrated/layered onto present schedule w/ a countdown clock allowing for whatever amount of time you preset for that routine). If it had/has that, then it's five stars for me."
Will not accept passcode after today's update. Have been a paid user for some time and NEED my info back. Please fix and I will update my review. Useless to me until resolved.
This app automatically downloaded when i did not ask for it. Very intrusive.
I've been using planner pro for at least 2 years. Has not disappointed!
Reminder is not working what I should do
Ok but.....
"if you don't stop to force ads clip watching, bye bye."
"App was excellent till recent, but I'm unable to add new task after recent updates."
"Cute and functional little organisation app. Used the free version for a couple of months, liked it, transitioned to Premium - it's a one-off payment for a lifetime subscription, thought it was worth it. Clean design, good system. Here's what I think would make the app even better: 1. Setting a duration for tasks, not just habits. 2. Being able to move untimed tasks up and down the list. 3. More task icons! These are just things I would like ideally - love the app regardless!"
Bring back Wunderlist. My list won't sync with people and I'm having issues.
Works fine for importing calendar. Can't say same for tasks. OS: Linux
"This apps not suitable for my needs. The reminder keep show every day, even the task mark as 'Done' (everyday I do click 'Done' at reminder, the next day, and next day, and next day, the reminder still come up). The logic for the apps does not make sense for me (I'm not a paid subscribber)."
"It's a good start...I currently have a 1 month subscription. Needs more habit type features. Needs to track , display and keep a record of current and longest streaks. Repeat option needs much more options like; 1. A way to track a task that's done a certain number of times a day like 3 times a day. 2. Repeat week, should also have the option to have the task done a certain amount of days not just on specific days. 3. Achievements should have an option for completing consecutive days."
great and easy to use app
Cool but really confusing
"I set a reminder since last week. It didn't even ring at the chime of the clock while I observed. It rang post 10min approx, that too when I accessed the app to see what's the fault. Please look into this bug."
the app is ok . it could be simpler to work. i had to fiddle around a bit and some persons may not have the patience to do so.
"This app seemed to have all the features I wanted, but the sync did not work after I paid $10 for the sync feature. I emailed their support with no reply. Very bad customer service."
"I thought it was a really good app until today. It started to crush and i couldn't do anything to backup. I lost all of my options, to-do lists,  achievements. Don't know what should i do, really disappointed. Auto back-up should be offline too and must be selected when we start to use app or you should use your own database system to backup files(not dropbox)"
"I like the app on how it organize your tasks. You can customize how you will be reminded and prioritized. Unfortunately, the alarm doesn't work. It either late or not working at all. I thought if I pay premium, it will fix. But it didn't. so 3/5."
Its been super helpful during this homeschooling process however sometimes the notifcation sound just keeps going and the only way to shut it off is to stop what im doing and go into the app itself. It wont let me remove it from my notifications during these times either. Its not everytime just sometimes.
"I do like the straight forwardness of this system it does what it says on the tin, needs to keep developing but in the theme it's in if it gets to clever like some systems it will loss it's position"
"After using this app for two months, it suddenly started not responding. So I have to redownload it, nd now my all data has been lost(all the tree species nd focused hours). Plesae provide sync option so that we don't loose it again. Thank you!"
NOTE TO SELF::: The demo version of this app is totally useless - so there is no way of knowing if this product will be able to meet my needs BEFORE paying for the premium version. I'll find another way to get my needs met. I'm sure there are other products available for free that would do the same things. Since I'm not allowed to testdrive all the bells and whistles - I am passing this app over. No thanks. UNINSTALLING.
