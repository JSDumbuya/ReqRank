Great idea in principle but it's so hard to work out what's going on that that so far it's useless :-(,0
"Don't like it much Event, Task, Favorites at the bottom confusion. Entering data is tedious too selected hide for completed task it may have deleted them. Need simple customization features and I HATE the computer time task settings which it uses. pros easy to read overview. Thx. mbf",0
Not easy to use also not effective,0
"Worthless, uninstalled after 2min what is the point of adding my schedule and goals without having a reminder!! This is the basic goal of the app you can't make it premium just make the full app with subscriptions instead of scamming people to have more downloads",0
I love this app..but after updating i cant even open the app in my phone and cant getting any new unlock tree... Please help me to use this aap,0
"Reminders only pop up when I remember to open the app, which defeats the whole purpose. If the reminders popped up automatically at the set times, I'd give the app 5 stars.",0
"Too difficult to figure out how to set up, can't add times to daily routines. This app is a waste of space.",0
You want me to pay $5 for the full version so I can set a task to repeat? My phone's planner does that for free.,0
"Paid for the premium app last year, now there is no history of my email address ever being registered despite me having the confirmation emails from them when I first paid for it. Lots of complaints on here. Get one of the open source habit trackers & back it up yourself to cloud storage rather than spending money with devs who change the app name slightly & try to charge again. Seen this happen so many times.",0
"Worst app I have ever used, it doesn't do anything.",0
"Whuup, sorry, need to pay for unlimited daily task. Nope",0
"I made several repeating tasks that are supposed to be repeated weekly by the day of the week. They seem to just multiply and now the same 4 tasks will show up 3 times each on a single day. I can't edit the original repeating ones, I can only delete them individually on the day they show up several times. This is VERY annoying. This app was a waste of my money. I paid for the ability to make repeating tasks. I'm very disappointed.",0
"Looks really complicated, and it's entirely prescription based. I felt like I needed to take a class to learn it. There are a lot of apps like this. I'll try another one.",0
"I deleted a list but I still get alarms for one of the tasks in that list, even after restarting my phone.",0
"For an app that's meant to help me organise my time more effectively, I didn't expect it would take the longest time to boot up compared to all the utility apps on my device... Really nice UI though...",0
I am not able to set the time . It is automatically taking the remainder timing,0
"Correct idea worng execution. The watch face UI cannont be operated like manually moving clock hands. The time zone stick moves at an interval of 1hr, I wanted to set it at any choosen time and add reminder from there. Big flop was it did not read my calender event and yes I did give necessary permission. phone - one plus 7 OS build- Oxygen OS 9.5.5 GM57AA Further Action- Uninstalling Outlook- Would like to try it post improvement",0
Would not load,0
not user friendly.,0
"This app was fine for years and then became extremely laggy. It also started duplicating weekly tasks to the point that I would have to delete five or six versions of a task in order to return it to one weekly. Often the delete or complete options have to be used multiple times on the same task before it actually disappears. I have basically stopped using it except as a calendar, but it's so slow it's not even efficient to be used for that.",0
"I am liking the app so far except for the fact that you can only add tasks to ""My Day"" for the present day. I LOVE the idea of a daily list, but it would be immensely better if you could plan for future days. It's super inconvenient to have to add all your tasks the morning of...",0
", every time I put a task in it removed the number in the name and put it in my inbox.... Why???",0
Ugly all white ui themes make almost no difference. No option to keep completed tasks in list. Sync is unreliable and does not even notify the user when unsuccessful. Service is down right now per their Twitter but app shows no errors; sync simply doesn't work. Web ui is extremely bloated and runs an unacceptable amount of client side scripts. Still better than the new Google tasks though.,0
Too hard to use,0
"I love all the recent changes you have made - especially the ability to undo things in the history. Could you please add an option to manually reorder tasks? I would like to put mine in the order that I do them throughout the day, and none of your sorting allows that. Thanks! Update: it's been 22 months since you said you'd make drag and drop sorting an option. I see monthly updates but not the one feature that would make this app user friendly. Don't promise what you won't deliver.",0
"The free version was great until now, but since they added advertisements to it (e. g. forced to watch an ad after creating an appointment) I cannot recommend it anymore, it is absolutely annoying, the Google calendar is the better alternative now.",0
"I was a customer of Any.Do for a while and on March 2020 i clearly asked them NOT to renew my subscription as i found a different company to provide me task manger services - Todoist. More than that - i even consult with Any.Do technical support team how to transfer my database to Todoist and over the phone, i ALSO remind them to cancel it. I received the cancellation notice and I DID NOT ask them to renew/continue any of Any.Do services. More than that - i also have the Invoice from the company i moved my services, Todoist, for the same period of time that Any.Do charged me for. After i tried to contact Any.Do they refused to refund me. Therefore, i let you and everybody to know that I WILL NOT USE ANY OF ANY.DO services anymore and recommend everyone that read this post DO NOT USE ANY.DO SERVICES or you taking a big risk that something like that will happen to you as well.",0
After I purchased the pro version. All my previous tress were deleted. Contacted support. They told me to log out and for the past couple of days I have been unable to log back in. Unable to view friends list or plant trees with friends😑 the support team is also not helping me quite well.,0
Nice polished but useless. There is no filter for tags. Web and app synch problems happens missing tasks. Not any scoring system. May good for amateurs but not for project managers. However I like the calendar view.,0
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.,0
I was disappointed coz it did not make any sound notifications once the tree has been planted. After following all instructions and enabling all permissions for the past few days. Still no luck.,0
wew,0
"I used this app for years - until the recent update where you now have to select ""deep mode"" for it to work properly. However, ""deep mode"" means giving permission for the app to read messages and contact details. I can't understand how this invasion of privacy is necessary and I have unfortunately deleted the app.",0
Have given all permissions yet unable to turn on deep focus mode. Plus the link that's supposed to explain permissions leads to a 404.,0
"The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to",0
My app is not opening .... I have uninstall and then install many times but still facing the same problem,0
Bought the premium version long ago but now it has ad on it.,0
when adding a task it transferring you to Google calendar then after adding the event it doesn't appear on the widget?,0
"This WAS a great list app. Then something happened and I stopped getting notifications. I checked the app and it said I needed to allow permissions due to Android 6.0. I've been on Android 7.0+ since I started using the app, but regardless, I checked and permissions were set and allowed the app to provide notifications. Still didnt work. I've tried resetting the phone, resetting permissions... nothing works. Now I'll try uninstalling it and using something else.",0
"As smart and skilled microsoft employees are this is a great app bu needs a lot of tweaks to be top notch. You camt change the name of a list you create, the completed or i should say deleted items in a list is stupid. If i delete items they should be gone not kept in a completed list that just grows and no delete all button and or not even a choice in settings to either delete items forever without a completed list or to have a completed list that grows and grows single item delete is dumb",0
i cant set my times for events bc theres no am/pm option. it keeps changing my time not allowing me to put the right thing..annoying,0
"DO NOT INSTALL THIS APP. I used to love it, but in the most recent update the advertisements have made it absolutely unusable. I am switching to google calendar and never looking back",0
Worst app,0
Can't sync calendar unless you pay which makes the unpaid version useless to me. I'm not going to go through my entire calendar and add my events by hand to a second calendar. Pointless.,0
Only notifications pop out no sound at all,0
"Try to make the app more automated, i have been following every steps but still it shows no notifications or alarm on time",0
After the update whenever I try o buy a new kind of tree the app closes I liked the app before but now i have losed my interest in it😒😒😒😒😒 Please fix this bug..,0
ANNOYED paid for this years ago PAID full version and used it and recommended it! Now I am asked to pay YEARLY to remove ads! what joke! I paid for full add free version already and there is nothing new to justify the yearly purchase...,0
I miss wonder list. To Do sucks. It is impossible to get anything entered without wanting to throwmy phone across the room. Dear Microsoft screw yourself.,0
After the mandatory change from Wunderlost the app worked wothout issue until today. The app signed out of the MS account for some reason and it just kept crashing endlessly and prevented the use of my phone. Why? I also had to sign in multiple times to be able to get it right. Why change it fron Wunderlist to do a worse job? Why break something that was working?,0
It's too confusing.,0
"Does not integrate month calendar view and 24hrs view within the circular widget graphics: it only shows 24hrs (12hrs in free version). Very restrictive: the widget shows full info for one day, and no info ahead, unless you select a different day. For the days ahead you need to leave the widget, and work in a different environment. Why complicate your life? Find a calendar app you like, stay with it, come back to Sectograph when (and if) the widget fully implements time and task management.",0
I have paid for premium however it will not let me use its features. I get a message asking me to upgrade to premium everytime I try to add a new habit. if I follow the instructions it just tells me I already own the product. Thanks for stealing my money.,0
Having issues with syncing with Google calendar. I added a task on TickTick and it's been over 12 hours and it still has not sync up to my Google calendar. I've tried refreshing but nothing showed up. I've looked at the help forum and many people have the same issue for some time now. I just purchased the pro and it's not worth it if it doesn't sync.,0
The majority of things are blocked off by subscription.,0
Pain. Ya have to create an account to access,0
"This is just a re-skinned Samsung calendar, don't waste your time",0
"What mess, can't undo a task if pop up is disappeared, this app is too overrated! Lean from ticktick...........!",0
"Super buggy on Android, have to close and open constantly for anything to work.",0
NO INSTRUCTIONS I can't even get started because there are no instructions. I put in list title groceries and that's it when I try to make a list it asks for sub titles won't let me even start a list just sends ya in circles DELETE DELETE,0
Y doesn't the reminder work!!! I m trying m trying changed all my settings according to this and it doesn't work at all it doesn't remind me i tried and set a particular time and i was waiting but it didn't i m fed up really this made me more anger than ever🤧🥵😶😶😶😶😑😑😑,0
I m just very lazy enough to use this app plus this app is not based on concept of habit building.Let's see how habbit is built u do task u get reward but here for sake of reward u only get Dots connected in pattern that's not motivating instead u can give some offers as reward.,0
Acceptable,0
"Daily emails, can't even see my important emails because of spammers like you",0
Can't add more than 5 task to calendar without monthly fee.,0
"I'm sure the premium might be fine, but all of the most important features are locked behind a paywall. I wanted a simple app that would let me set repeated reminders on my phone, but this surely isnt it. At first, it told me I just needed to sign up to do that, so I did, but then it said I needed premium! Very misleading, I immediately uninstalled because that is just untrustworthy behaviour to me.",0
"Syncing with Alexa takes over 10-15 minutes which renders it unusable. Any.do, before you post your generic response: yes, I added the skill to my Alexa and, yes, I logged into my accounts. It syncs... kind of... so I can verify the two accounts are talking... just not well at all. When I use Wunderlist or Google Tasks or just Alexa by itself, the changes are instantly viewable across all platforms. The only reason I downloaded with app was to give me more control over my Alexa lists (which for some insane reason you cannot reorder). The extremely lag in syncing Any.do with Alexa renders this app useless. The UI looks really nice and user friendly, so I bumped it up to 2 stars.",0
Stupid app,0
"Do you love apps that design their experience to be poor unless you pay ongoing ""subscriptions"" for static feature sets that make the experience barely tolerable? Do you prefer having money siphoned from your account over and over again instead of paying a single small fee once for an app, like we used to see? Then this is the app for you! Add one more debit to your bank account they hope you'll forget about (and statistically speaking - you will) for a stagnant app you'll forget about in a week",0
"The app itself is great. I used it quite regularly a few years back but when I tried to use it again it seems that the 'new' owners don't acknowledge their 'lifetime' subscription. Sure hope my emails get more results besides ... /ignore kthnxbye Sent an email ... they said they opened a ticket and then ... crickets. Nice .. thanks, downgraded to",0
google calander doesnt synchronise.,0
"Failed at the first hurdle, couldnt customise my character to even get started. Next button worked thats about it. galaxy S8",0
Buggy as all hell. The advertisement is right. It gamifies tasks... But that's it. No tracking history of your habits. Inaccurate as all hell. Worst of all is you can't delete your account. They'll forever keep your data. I'm sure that's illegal in parts of this country and around the world. Definitely don't use your real email to sign up to test it out.,0
"After getting the premium subscription I found that, Windows 10 app doesn't have any app lock mechanism. So anyone using the machine has access to Todoist! I'd request you to fix these kind of basic things before bringing more features.",0
"Can't see new topics of discussion. Also can't add discussion topic even though I have excellent internet connection, Wi Fi or Data. Please fix. I have no connection issues with any of my other apps.",0
please add night mode! I study at night and the bright green screen hurts my eyes. Realluy consider this as an option tha many of us who use this app prefer a less bright screen that is better for the eyes.WE WANT NIGHT MODE!!,0
"Looks polished app but time after time new issues come up. Raising these issues with the developer rarely gets timely response or interest in fixing it (I'm a paid user). Today, tasks lost their subtasks on one device, while the 2nd device is OK (for now) || to devs: Task (and their subs) used to sync across devices via Google Drive.. Seems like you eliminated this feature by switching to Google Tasks in your recent update. Totally useless app now for me (at least)",0
They are always changing Something after updates. And it isn't always functional like used to be,0
"Crippled version without even a way to purchase outright. EDIT: I'll be clearer. Many apps features are disabled. But there is no way to just buy the app. The only option is some ongoing payment subscription which makes no sense as this app does not provide any ongoing or backend service, it's just an app! and a simple one at that. It's like going to buy a water bottle and going to check out they take your credit card info and charge you the same price every year that you use the bottle. Bottom line, it's just a scummy business practice.",0
It's kinda bad sorry,0
"This is good, but i can't use in my phone for more than a day, Its not opening in my samsung note10 lite. Please suggest a way to rectify this issue.",0
"Monthly payments for a todo app? Not gonna happen, thank you.",0
"I installed this app in April and then it started crashing a lot. So I re-installed it and all my data had been lost. After that I installed it again on 9th June to give it another try and after 3 days the same thing happened again. I loved the app a lot so I bought the pro version but it still keeps crashing. All my settings, allow list, custom phrases, reminders and tags are always deleted after re-installing it THRICE . I use Samsung Galaxy S8. Fix it soon or refund me my money. Pathetic app.",0
"App is so much good , best app , i want to give 5 star but not giving so that u can notice me . After its update ,my app is not opening il, if i reinstall it , my coins will lost and trees also . Please help me what to do",0
It sucks. My wife and I loved Wunderlist. We were synced with no problems. We have tried a million times to sync this bullshxt with no success.,0
Too much fluff. Difficult to see the actual progress.,0
"Loved TickTick - great interface and the widget was perfect. Unfortunately I had to move on to Todoist. TickTick doesn't have Alexa capabilities and that's a deal breaker. For a while, IFTTT and Gmail provided a good workaround, but recent changes to Gmail rendered that functionality inoperable. TickTick, get on board with Alexa and I'll come back.",0
"Needs a built in timer and some stats to make it the best productivity to-do out there.. for now it's just a generic to-do with folders. Hoping it gets an update with those features soon as I do love the design and other Microsoft products, for now I'm forced to use another to-do manager. :(",0
"Can't even log in. Seems to stop working or freeze up every time. Just downloaded the app for the first time, can't make a new account or log in. Waste of time, will be looking for other apps that actually let me get past the log in screen.",0
So bad bad bad,0
Premium version only,0
"I got the premium version The main drawbacks of this app are: 1- I cannot customize the categories 2- If I do a task earlier, it still alarming on scheduled alarming time 3- removing done tasks is not available Just moved to the bottom",0
I have been a subscriber of the pro version for years when this new version came out I tried it and there were problems. I tried it again and it seems to work well. I tried running with one alarm and now it dosen't stop when I acknowledge it I'm going back to the old version. I have removed pro 2 if the problem pesiststs I will have to find a new calendar. Very frustrated.,0
Why is it impossible to see text of event (I PURCHASED pro version and sent You email) I just resent an email ... with screenshot,0
"Seems like it could be fun, I just had a hard time getting into it.",0
Not a fan. I paid for the upgrade and it isn't working out for me. Maybe others will like it but I don't.,0
"I like the app a lot, bit I can not make the notifications sound to work. I have enabled all notifications in setting - both the phone and the app but the only notification I'm getting is in the notification bar? Without the notification sound the app is quite useless.",0
Slow. Not user friendly. If you type fast words repeat.,0
Used it until simple backup was premiumized. Restore wont work between different versions unless you modi-hack the file. Author would not tell you that you can do it though if you ask his help ! . Restore dont recognize my backup file at all so all my lists are basically inaccessible now. Will never install this again and I suggest anyone who values his data not to !,0
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.,0
"I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys.",0
"Find another app. Wunderlist was much better. When you sort alphabetically then prioritize an item, it doesn't move to the top of the list. Wunderlist would allow sorting and when it was starred, move to the top.",0
Pretty cheap when basic features are premium and cost $4 - $5.5 monthly. Immediately uninstalled. I'll stick to Any.do for now. Premium is almost half-price.,0
I bought the full version of gTasks Pro from this company and now it's unavailable. Think twice before buying from them.,0
I keep getting a message saying the app can't connect to the server and every time I tap on a different colour of skin or shirt it stays the same.,0
When you try to write a task and you want to set the reminder at the same time you have to make a reminder for each one and its wasting my time. If I could I would rate this app 0 stars,0
"Need to access my tasks on my phone grouped same as Task Pane in Outlook Task Pane in desktop. Functioned acceptably prior to an update May 7th. Planned smart list previously included overdue items in current day's list, thus automatically rolling over incomplete tasks. Planned also included all tasks GROUPED by date. Microsoft responded 5/11 with intent to add combined view soon and if the All Smartlist was acceptable workaround. NO, it is no better than the Task or Planned Smartlist.",0
"Reduced to 1 star after second repetitive dev response. (edit after dev response) I get having ads, but full screen ads that you have to wait to skip are very annoying. I am fine with ads that appear at the bottom. Great app until the full screen ads appeared",0
"Used to be a great app, but I've moved phones, but the sync did not work and all tracking data has been lost. Even after having paid $18 for premium. Very much a shame.",0
The application looks nice and simple. But the synchronization between mobile and desktop version is awful. A lot of pictures from tasks which were added via desktop version are not accessible on mobile and vise versa,0
The app was amazing but lately it's been crashing a lot and i had to uninstall and reinstall it and yet it keeps in crashing i lost my data and it's frustrating,0
"Too much configuration, not very intuitive, I'm looking for something simple that only counts something for the day, not to set goals, reminders, notes, and all that overload of information that keep jumping from screen to screen, not looking for enterprise app just for personal use.",0
Can't match Ticktick with your arrogant attitude.,0
New update causing app to freeze. Pls correct it immediately.,0
I'm better with myself nowadays. Cheers,0

"Reminders, the most basic of features, is ""premium"" in this app.",0
"I have been using the fully unlocked version of this application for over a year. This is a fantastic app! However, it lacks the capability to sync with outlook calendars. For example, if I have subscribed to my work outlook calendar in Google calendar, the events will not be synchronized with Sectograph. This would be fine if this was the documented behavior of this application. However, subscribed-outlook calendars are selectable from the calendar selection menu...",0
Couldn't figure out how to set reminder times won't do anything other then am,0
I have only 86 coins. But I couldn't start the count down as it has no such option. It has only and option as ' unlock it' what's that . Please fix it. It took my whole time inorder to search about that. But failed. How can I unlock with 86 coins. They don't have any alternative ways to go inside the app. It helped me in the morning but now it's making me angry,0

"This app is malware/scam. I don't even have the app and it's charged me 38 dollars for a yearly subscription, do not buy, I'm having to now look into suing the people behind this just based on the principle of not letting them get away with this. I hope the 38 dollars was worth hundreds of dollars in court fees.",0
I really like the app/online portal but having everything in one does me no good w/o push notifications & I wish this had a widget so I didn't have to open the app to look at everything.i paid for this & I don't feel like I got my investment back as I maybe use the app once in a blue moon. It looks great but it just doesn't work to what I feel is it's full protein. I hope you add this & don't make me pay for it.,0
"I'm changing the rating into two stars because the sync feature which previously work fine has no longer work. Looking at the last update I feel like the developer had abandoned this apps, which is quite sad considering this usef to be the best apps on building habit.",0
"I love it except, and this is a big issue for me, it's totally server based. Want to update anything, but have a bad internet connection? Too bad, it's either going to take forever or fail. I would use and maybe even pay for this app to just have a way to have everything first be saved on my device. So, back to hunting for a to-do app. Edit 3/23: I have to drop my review on this to 1 star. You can manually edit values within the app for stats making any it unreasonable that I need internet.",0
it is so stupid that i have to be coneccted to my calender and cant just create what i want. to much work not worth it,0
Not what I thought it was... This only blocks out time for your calendars. I was looking for something that would help with daily routines. 😕. I even tried to use the calendar before giving up... But it refused to sync. So it's useless,0
Confusing,0
"Widget has been broken with the latest update, keeps reverting back to the My Day view and then once it does that the button at the top left doesn't work anymore and so can't be switched to show other lists without removing the widget and recreating it, please fix!",0
Recently it crashes in background,0
"This app is a prime example of building a mountain out of a mold hill. The developer does not knot how to make it simple & friendly. The app is very chaotic. Completed tasks do not go away after pressed completed. If deleted from today's list, tasks that have a repeat schedule also disappeared forever. The only reminder this app does right is to remind me how frustrating it is to use. I have uninstalled it on all my phones.",0
"No Resent Updates, no Local Backup Option. Other than that it's Good.",0
fun and helpful. graphics are awesome. just needs a few tweaks. too easy to cheat. i don't like the tavern because i am in recovery from drugs and alcohol so it's kinda anthemic. maybe a temple option would be a better social forum for inclusion for those of us who don't drink and/or use drugs. it would also be nice if you could continue to see completed to-do items after you have checked them so you can continue to visualize your progress.,0
"They have clearly made this app about data mining, it use to be very good but now it just wants access to unnecessary information to work properly.",0
"Doesn't allow you to sort completed tasks. I have a single grocery list with 300 tasks in it's completed section that's named by section using tags like ""Produce - onions"". I used to be able to sort completed tasks alphabetically making it easy to have a running list where I could add back frequently purchased items. Now everything is lost automatically placed in completed tasks by completion chronology. Is a pain.",0
expensive,0
No Google tasks integration.,0
Difficult login forces work or school address. Lost Wunderlist lists as a result,0
"You've had all this time since you started ""fresh"" when you couldn't make Wunderlist do what you want and you still have syncing issues. Write some goddamn integration tests. Syncing should be the most basic functionality that you focus on since without it the app is actually useless.",0
"It's good but for some reason, it keeps switching around everything. And I can't seem to move them around, so I have to delete them and start again. A bit frustrating but has a great purpose.",0
I don't understand why it's not letting me type in it. It gets hanged everytime. I meant that amake ora onek birokto kortese....sorry I speak only Bahamian,0
Something weird is happening! I got a message saying that my tree has grown even if I didn't grow one ( after I click on give up button) or even started a new one afterwards!!?? Why this is happening??!!,0
not a bad app but DONT pay for the premium. The widgets dont work!!,0
It won't let me remove my subscription,0
Suddenly the app will stop working and I have to reinstall it again. And each time I install this app I'm loosing my data . App is excellent but this issue is horrible. I already sent mail addressing this issue but no response and same thing is repeating. I'm facing the same problem again. It's horrible. It's becoming worst it's not at all working,0
Wish I could sync it across multiple devices :(,0
You cannot change the default online calendar. This does me no good to only have multiple local calendars.,0

"No Resent Updates, no Local Backup Option. Other than that it's Good.",0
MS has screwed up wunderlist the same as to skype.... So clunky and average poorly thought out; should have just changed wunderlists logo and colour scheme. The desktop version is slow (10s) to respond. You can be doing changes on the desktop and it get jammed up with app.,0
Switching from one list to another stinks. Otherwise helpful,0
I wish there was a clearer distinction between the Pro and Free modes. All the popups I found during exploration just deterred me and I found the timer didn't even work properly. It was pretty though and I like the concept.,0
"No free trial, cant even try it, JUNK. then they spam you forever",0
"Was good on Windows mobile, then later became guglifyied and useless. Pass.",0
Lots of In-app purchases ... Not worth the time .,0
"This app was great, but now in 14.1.0 I can no longer click on a project and see all of its sub-projects and their tasks at once. This is a stupidly frustrating change and it completely messes up how I use the app. Why not make this a setting I can change back, OR leave it alone altogether? I will be manually rolling this app back. Thanks for making more work for me guys. SERIOUSLY STUPID ""UPDATE"".",0
It's been months and I still cannot delete this one habit. It will not delete and nothing I've been sent has been helpful to figure out why. About ready to find a different app cause it's driving me nuts.,0
Mixed great app but don't by premium. Won't work without play services and developer unresponsive,0
"I'm sure it would be great if it didn't pick and chose what events to display from my calendar. I have multiple events logged in my calendar, the only calendar it's synced to and the only calendar those events are logged on, yet just one of them shows up. It has a lovely design, but that doesn't mean anything when the app doesn't actually work for what it's intended for.",0
Used to be my favorite app! Changed phones and it doesn't recognize my premium purchase. I've been emailing for support for two months with no response. So disappointed.,0
Be aware: if you purchase the paid version and then try to cancel within the 14 days trial. You won't be able to. They only reply once a day if you contact them and every time you contact them you have to explain that you want to cancel the service making the days passed by and after a while they just stop replying back. Using these shady tactics to make the 14 days goes by so you can't cancel after that. This company is a joke!,0
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks",0
After purchase of pro version I lost all of my 500+ coins.,0
"I'm at awe how the tick tick guys keep managing to destroy a perfectly working app by having to redesign it every once in a while just for the sake of saying that they're keeping the app running. Now I can't delete the messages because it's almost barely visible once I push the three dots or lines on the tasks and there is no way to scroll the choices to see the delete option. Please, for the love of gods, don't work so hard to ruin a perfectly functioning software. I'd love to ask, just why?",0
"This is the only Microsoft app with no support for proper status bar and navigation bar colouring, the devs working on this app are lazy af especially compared to the ones working on the outlook and onedrive app",0
two stars bc i have adhd AND i REALLY wanted it to work. it isn't user friendly and i can't give it the time of day to sit and figure it out. I'll try again later.... maybe this fall?,0
Super glitchy. Too frustrating to bother trying to use it.,0
"The app was an okay task organizer at best, although it required internet and was ridden with adds and paywalls for a monthly ""premium"" subscription. Even if they asked for support, id prefer a one time payment of a higher amount like, $5 to unlock all features.",0
the app requires premium membership to use the widget. defeats the point for me,0
I like the way it's present itself but advantage if your not getting any notification ring ......in the system I allowed everything I needed too but still it's not working out,0
"The layout was horrible, the events and the scheduled items don't sync.",0
"I love the app, but it won't sync.",0
"Need to be online to use this app. In case you make changes in offline mode. It doesn't sync automatically when online. You need to again make those changes. Enable offline feature and offline data should be synced when ever we are online. Once this is done, you got my 5 star.",0
"I'm shocked and disappointed to see that suddenly my records from the past few days were gone, it was okay last night but when I opened the app, my trees were gone. I availed the premium version of this app, but I didn't see this errors coming. Please let me understand why it happened.",0
"I like the app, but for the past day I haven't got any notifications.",0
New update has ruined the app...the reminder option is no longer available with ringtones...why the heck should I keep this app now in my phone... deleting....,0
"Idk what happened, but from the start app was just alright, and it was very nice and I was happy that i found it. But since a few hours it just stopped working! When I'm trying to complete the task it just doesn't count. The mark is appears, but several seconds later it vanishes!!! And also when I'm trying to complete a part of assignment it doesn't count. Please fix :(",0
I still can't sign up or log in. Store is empty and it crashes when I press the premium tags in store. Connection errors(Tells me im not connected to a network). Deep Focus still lets me browse other apps.,0
"Mostly OK. Needs option to disallow delete of notifications. Only when the notification is Snoozed or marked as Completed should the notification be cleared. Also, once the notification is deleted there is no way to then go into the app and set a snooze time for the task to realert.",0
I couldn't even log in,0
I was looking forward to using this app. But it wont even let me pick out an avatar. Things just go blank on the app and tells me I'm missing information when I clearly am not. What a bummer,0
It is very awkward cauz you need to give it a proper plan,0
"Worst app I have ever used, it doesn't do anything.",0
Only for singlr use.. cant assign task and sub task to others,0
"Seems like it could be very helpful. Getting very frustrated with it always opening on monthly view even though I have weekly view selected in settings. Even tried switching it, but no matter what opens on monthly",0
"Can't even start it properly. Just says ""Path 'profile.name' is required.""",0
This used to be a very good calendar app with plenty of good features in the free version already. Unfortunately they introduced intrusive full-screen ads recently to force you into buying the premium version. I'll rather switch to another calendar app than be blackmailed like that.,0
"I have used this app for a couple of years now and it was great. It had small banner ads before, however recently they have incorporated video ads which play every time you input a new plan. This is incredibly tedious and a massive waste of time. DO NOT DOWNLOAD.",0
That app is good but I could not benifit,0
"I like the app, but I have to give it one star now because the notifications stopped working after some recent update (Mi 9, MIUI 12) and the support doesn't answer my questions.",0
Want to like it. So far half of the set up items aren't even showing up for my samsung s8. All the purple screens are blank. Was excited to try but it doesn't work.,0
Was good. But not keeping up with the world. Having font size a pay feature with today's high resolution displays make the text so tiny that it can't be read. So in order to use the free version I have to pay for it.,0
Did not sign up. App not even on my phone. This payment deduction will be reported and I request you refund my money immediately.,0
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.,0
"Doesn't sync reliably, and that's one of the most critical features for a calendar app.",0
"I have been using this for more than a year now, it was great, this is where i jot down notes on my classes and meetings, but this new update may have a bug i cant access it even with the correct pin i have entered Pls fix this issue, thanks",0
I just installed this app and it's always on landscape view. Please fix this soon. Thank you!,0
I can press middle button and start using Instagram and still count down continues,0
"Horrible the app crashed and I was never able to open it. I had it for weeks and whenever I opened it, it crashed .",0
"Pro user here: I have 2 issues 1. After I clear/kill the app (swipe away in the multi-task mode) the Forest app ceases to work and I can use any other app. Please fix this. (Pixel 2 user) 2. Why can't Pro-users watch an Ad to double their coins? We should have the liberty to avail this feature too. I used to double my coins (by watching 30 second ads) before I paid for the app, and now I can't do it anymore. That's not fair.",0
Please give us a way of disabling the red notification dot. It serves no purpose if I can't tell what it's for. Get rid of it or make it more clear what it's indicating. UX should never be an afterthought.,0
"It works! Does what it's supposed to do, although I don't require any features other than setting an appointment/event, and being reminded of it. Unobtrusive, even when using it as a free version only. I'll probably upgrade to PRO just to reward the developer. Edit: The new 30 second ads really screw this up.",0
"If you want to use it properly, you have to pay for the Pro version. It is not user-friendly.",0
DO NOT BUY PREMIUM Version!! App stopped synching 7/27/2019 and is no longer supported. I got Premium to sync to new phone since I've been using the app for over a year and wanted to keep tracking. $10 wasted! Very disappointing because basic version is great - simple but fully functional and effective for tracking up to 5 habits. Good visuals and the ability to make notes. Premium = tracking >5 habits and syncing across devices but no more! Would be 4 stars if still supported and worked.,0
"This is an expensive app. That being said, it's the most low-rent experience you can imagine. For example, when you create a list item and need to edit it, you're completely out of luck because that can't happen. The best you can do is delete it and type it in (again) correctly since edit is not an option. By the way, deleting an item from your list is a multi multi step process. (update: developer noted that editing was possible (though, multiple steps required), item deletes still impossible)",0
The notification sound isn't coming with this version whether I close or keep the app open. I checked all my phone notification settings and also the app settings. All are on sound yet there is no sound alert after completion of the tree plantation. This is very inconvenient. Please rectify.,0
the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it. very annoying.,0
This app is not worth the $6 a year. Poorly developed with several glitches.,0
When i set to remind me daily it shows even in past and it doesn't remind me kindly let me know the way to set it proper,0
Good,0
"Widget is horrible. Keeps switching to ""my day"" and won't allow me to change it. Really expected better from Microsoft.",0
I really liked this until I realized that unfinished daily/repeating tasks get marked as done whether you complete them or not the next day. That makes it pretty useless for tracking tasks I need to do each week.,0
"Good app but don't bother with premium. I bought premium for the ""powerful widgets"" and ability to track extra habits. Don't bother. The widgets are nothing special and if you read the tips section the developer even says it's best to only track a few habits at a time! After feeling ripped off I emailed the developer twice requesting a refund but have received no reply. Great free app but don't waste your money on premium.",0
"Sync DOES NOT work! I've tried multiple times to get it to work and my internet connection is just fine. Had to switch phones when my old phone died and can't get my old data back on the app because sync doesn't work. Also no way to import data. Great app if the feature worked or could import data, but rendered useless because of this. So if I switch phones or have to reset to factory standards, I lose everything. Paid quite a bit for this app just for this feature alone, but it DOES NOT work.",0
confusing and definitely didn't motivate me to do tasks. just spent hours trying to figure out how to add personalized tasks.,0
"I'm sure the premium might be fine, but all of the most important features are locked behind a paywall. I wanted a simple app that would let me set repeated reminders on my phone, but this surely isnt it. At first, it told me I just needed to sign up to do that, so I did, but then it said I needed premium! Very misleading, I immediately uninstalled because that is just untrustworthy behaviour to me.",0
"Under subtitle *security* ""However, please note that we cannot guarantee that the information will not be exposed as a result of unauthorized penetration to our servers"" Sorry no thanks.i just downloaded but after reading privacy policy i prefer going thru •Google official •one & app like calendar required lot of access ,&i personally don't wanna bleach my data like this..btw the tq for placing the info it to let us know :)",0
good,0
Isn't half as good as Wunderlist. Find another app.,0
I haven't even opened this app and it's already drained 30 percent of my battery! Wow. Waste of time and space.,0
Widget not working - this app is normally fantastic but lately my widgets are blank all the time. Very frustrating!,0
"over basic, definitely not worth 200 per year. pictures shown are not what the app looks like.",0
"2 many ads. I used this for 4 yrs and 2 cell phones no problem. I used to brag about this app lol. Miss me with the excuses about why things changed(""it helps maintain the app""). You weren't making enough and sold out I respect it but I guess I gotta do the same. ✌️ Peace out and good luck. To all those looking for a better app ""Simple Calender"" over @ simplemobile tools. I hear great things.",0
Loved this app until I updated updated it. Gibberish on every day now. It is terrible. Like this on my phone and tablet!!!!! How do I fix. I depend on this planner!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!,0
I dont understand how it works. Not very clear on how to use it. And it comstantly showed notifications for anything i made a note of,0
Hate,0
"I've used this app for years and have loved it up until now. Now I get full page ads that sit there for 5 seconds and disrupt what I'm doing. I don't mind a full page ad that I can back out of or scrolling ads at the bottom, but to force me to watch a 5 second ad is not reasonable. Seems like they're forcing you to pay up or move on to another app. If this continues I'll find another app.",0
"Worthless, u can add tasks and things to do in the future but it won't remind you or allow u to set alarms unless you pay for premium membership... Lame.. #instantdelete",0
"I did the free trial. This planner does NOT have push notifications. You can set up your events and appointments, even make them reoccurring, but Artful Agenda App will NOT remind you or notify you. What good is a digital planner if it does not have push notifications. If I am going to pay for an app, it should at least have most of the features a free app has.",0
Not Making an Account!,0
"complicated , dislike the pro version. microft to -do list is better",0
the app is awesome. but it made my phone drain 30% battery per day in the background which makes it useless,0
Subscription required just to set a reminder.,0
"Widget not working again.. please fix it. it has a bug, i use poco f1, in desktop widget, as soon as i restart my phone, your widget stop responding, just shows an empty list. When we remove it and add it back from widget list. It works for some days,but problem keeps on occuring times and again. Please fix it.",0
"I installed it, used it for 50mins and planted a tree. And the app suddenly crashed and kept crashing on my Vivo Z1 pro, so I had to uninstall. Very bad first impression!",0
MS has screwed up wunderlist the same as to skype.... So clunky and average poorly thought out; should have just changed wunderlists logo and colour scheme. The desktop version is slow (10s) to respond. You can be doing changes on the desktop and it get jammed up with app.,0
always freezing,0
"I spent hours trying to get my Wunderlist info imported to todoist with no success. Looks like it might be a decent app, but guess I'll never know.",0
If u want to study you need to plan DON'T USE APPS,0
Couldn't figure out how to set reminder times won't do anything other then am,0
"it's clear to me that this is the best todo app, and I've used it for a long time, but having reminders be a premium feature is just unreasonable as it's impossible to use a todo app without them. I'll be switching to TickTick.",0
Only 5 items on free version. Would be nice to have that clear so I don't have to waste my time and give out my email.,0
you need to subscrib the app to use it they make alot of thing lock and to unlock it you need to subscrib .,0
"App works pretty well, but if they want me to list out all events and plans in my life, their Privacy Policy needs to get stronger and be better defined. ""We collect your data; here's a vague description of what. We keep it as long as we've decided we need to; and we won't tell you how long that is. We also completely change this policy in a way that we're break the Policy you may have originally agreed to, but it's your responsibility as the user to make sure we don't break our end of the deal. Don't like this? Delete the app"" .. basically the Privacy Policy. Not exactly trust encouraging. Fix this in a privacy friendly way and I'll change my review",0
"hi, i am not able to use the paid version to full. Kindly help me. the help and feedback is not loading itself.",0
"I'm looking for a Wunderlist replacement. This is nice has some folder features that I'm using, but paying that much for the ability to set reminders or adding notes is insane.",0
"No Grocery widget, Ridiculous... The task widget is confusing, I just want to be able to add stuff simply on the fly.",0
Used to be amazing and now ads have completely ruined this app. Thanks for the years and cya,0
"Not a fan of being constantly reminded the moment I begin 2 experience your app that every setting or option is not fully functional or could be better with a subscription Everytime I look @ settings I'm reminded, when I configure the app I'm told about the subscription of $35/year. How bout letting users experience the full benefits of what u have 2 offer for 30 days b4 making us sign a yearly sub instead of 7 day free trial? This is an opportunity 4 u to humble your customer base #SunriseApp",0
"I put a tree and complete it's process. I get a notification that my tree has grown but when I open the app, The tree is withered. This has been continuing since oct2019 I've checked all my settings in phone so don't you ask me to change my permissions. There are bugs from your side. I simply want a app with tree going on sending notification when I open other app. Just give the version of 2018 back. It was best.",0
Migrating to a new phone was completely messed-up. All my tasks were changed to all day tasks and all appointments hours were lost! Unacceptable errors!!! Calendar can not be deleted - error 'check your internet connection' despite of the fact there was a connection. I use PRO version - meaning I bought it.,0
This is a waste app. After few days it started to shiw nothing and it says it takes time to sync with the calender but still after 24 hrs they dont sync. Please dont install this app and then expect to be productive.,0
wouldnt let me make an regular account without linking something to it.,0
"I really did not like the fact that when I set an exact time for stuff, I can not sort to according to that, so If i want to plan my day, 10 am i have to do a, 11 am i have to do b, i can not sort it by time",0
"Lots of emails notifications that you can not stop! Most of the features you need - including seeing a completed task - are all in the pro version (needs payment!) Edit after ""Doist"" reply: I mean the email notifications for the due jobs on the lists. They keep filling my email every day and I could not stop them!",0
"Dear developers, thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app! It was not pleasant at all, believe me!",0
Good,0
"Functions fine in general, easy drag to subtasks. Can't adjust the Notifications to not go through ""Do not disturb"" mode (bad if you work off shifts), can't set timing of notifications. In a productivity app, scheduling is important. Reminders require premium, seriously? I'll just install one of the tons of free apps that include it for free rather than pay $3 month. Overall: Average functioning app that requires paid premium for some basic functions.",0
"I had and paid for the premium version back then when it was called ""Habit Bull"" I loved it but since now they changed to ""Habit Tracker"" I no longer have the premium add ons and they expect for me to pay again. No thanks.",0
"Very nice and interesting concept but completely useless because you flipping need wifi to update your checklist?! Furthermore even if my parents didn't control my wifi and I had full access, there should be a way to see all your tasks etc at a glance without having to scroll so much. Also what's the point if you can just go in the settings and set the amount of money you want? And a bunch of my friends joined habitica only to leave because it takes up too much time, and it's not fun enough.",0
"Loses task lists on Premium - Don't upgrade So annoyed. loved and recommended this app til I upgraded 2 weeks ago. Got a new phone & realised tasks weren't backed up to my GMail account (annoying). Copying the lists over wasn't easy either (annoying). Paid for the upgrade, have now lost 3 of my lists...vanished from menu. No reason, not deleted and not in deleted items. Can't find out how to sign out or cancel premium account. Use the basic option and don't change your phone!",0
"At first you will get motivated by seeing this app. Later after paying whenever you choose a tree it crashes down. Moreover even you use some of the other apps(not all) during growing plant, app won't find and still it grows. Lots of flaws and bugs. What is the procedure to get refund????",0
Good but the paid version did not work as I wanted to use it more so I was disappointed,0
Missing the widget for iOS A to-do/reminder app is incomplete without a widget. Otherwise 5 stars.,0
"Every entry gets copied so I end up with 2 of everything, one in the color I designate and the other in the standard color. If I delete 1 I loose both. I used this calendar for years for my business and loved it but the latest update killed it.",0
"While everything else about this app is good, the process of scheduling a task is frustrating. Half of the time, it fails to recognize what I'm trying to set. You should just bring back the old scheduling layout from a few years ago. That was easy.",0
"The latest update is poorly designed for users with lots of tasks, completely changes the old interface, with attending bugs, out of the blue. Biggest fan to dead in the water overnight. Shocker.",0
"This app worked well at first, but it kept altering my entries no matter how many times I changed them. Not sure if it's a problem just with syncing accounts.",0
Chinese,0
"Please update the app, i want to use the app, but After a day ,alarm is not ringing , i think this app have too much bugs and problems",0
"edit : something more important, please don't make the user logged out after using vpn, it's a pain to log in every time this app is great, but please add the copy list feature on android too, and also ""uncheck all"" feature so i can reuse a routine list without uncheking all one by one",0
"Norton Antivirus reported this as a malicious App, and recommended I uninstall. After paying for the pro version I felt it was very lacking. No portrait mode on tablet, no day mode on phone, no way to adjust the length of a meeting beyond that of the default meeting settings.",0
Without syncing to the cloud this todo app is unfortunately worthless. Love it otherwise and would have given it 4 or 5 stars. Please add sync since in my quest to find a good todo app this is the only one I've seen that doesn't sync anywhere between devices.,0
"Only rated 2 stars because of the ability to sync with the calendar apps on the phone and the ability to cross out any tasks once finished. However, the app is fairly simple with tasks laid out like a shopping or to do list with the inability to edit the timings of tasks. I had set an appointment for 1:30 but the app had automatically set it for 10:00 am and not allowing me to edit it. Also, it would have been nice for the tasks to be laid out in calendar format with color-coding options.",0
"App works good. But with the latest update, 25 seconds of ad.. for adding an appointment. Not recommended after the update.",0
"Awful support, unable to move re-occuring tasks before completing previous one, look up the definition of planning again.",0
"You can't set a location by name, only address. Yes I tried setting my location manually, like that would be at all useful. Do you even understand what I'm saying? I CANT TYPE IN LA FITNESS AND GET AN ADDRESS. It will just send me to whichever is closest. Setting my location wouldn't help, it would just send me to the closest one to my manual instead of one that may be further... Worthless.",0
I buy pro version but it features are not given to me,0
"Why this app not giving any notification sound after the set time?? (Everytime After updates) this is not the first time this happen. Need to unistall n insall again for the sound. N after that, all ur progress n track in the past are all lost jz cz u hv to uninstall as there are no more notification sound. (Ps : Phone not in silent!! )",0
"DO NOT PAY FOR UPGRADE!! If you upgrade it just messes the app up. I have to manually change days every morning now. If it weren't for that, it'd be great. Please fix.",0
"dont like the layout, not very user friendly and you can't see your completed tasks unless you pay a monthly fee that is overpriced. don't recommend. there are much better apps that cost much less or are free.",0
The free version is crippled. 3 lists max. Seriously? Just use DTG GTD. To do app with free unlimited nested to-do lists with tags and reminders.,0
"1) create 80 000 events to several exchange calendars ... Story continues: I installed several other calendars. Few of them didn't cause any problem. Google Calendar. Very smooth, no any ANR. Agenda+ no ANR. So - for everything is responsible Nine. Yes sure. The same way is Nine responsible for neverending resizing font of week widget isn't it? Still one thing - making event colour without additional identification to which calendar event belongs it is confusing.",0
Change of days in app is a major problem. I wish it would happen smoothly.,0
Recently a ridiculous amount of advertising has been added to this app & I'm unable to add appointments while I wait for the ad that covers the whole screen to finish. I can no longer use this as its affecting my business. It has been a good calendar for years but i will be deleting it asap. Update - the developer responded & said that an ad appears only every 18 hrs... THIS IS INCORRECT. An ad appears after every diary entry + other times too. I enter multiple entries every day so get many ads.,0
I can't sign in. It was working fine before but now i can't even sign in.,0
"28 Oct 2018: same problem. Repeating tasks do not update and advance to next due date when completed. Checks it as done and then unchecks sometime at night with previous due date. 27 Oct 2018: After hearing back from the author, giving it another shot. Put two repeating tasks on it. See how it goes. 27 Oct 2018: This app didn't work as well for me. It would regularly uncheck tasks I'd completed or check tasks I'd not completed. The repeating task function didn't work well either.",0
"Great concept, but really quite bad execution. With so many bugs even in the new player introduction it feels like an early access, not v2.2 of anything. Surprised to learn that it's been in public release for 4 years now. I would be ashamed to make or spend money from any transaction within this game. I'm not usually this harsh, and I hope none of the devs take this review personally, but get it together. Needs a major QOL & UX overhaul before I would consider the concept v1.0 complete.",0
I mean the app started seeming really nice and has a lot of work put into it but here me out if your looking for a app that is free and dont want to spend $ for daily reminders this is not it but if you dont mind paying like 7 $ this your app and with that 7 dollars you can get cool extra stuff,0
Does this app truly have reminders?? It refused to remind me of my event,0
Reminder is chargeable service . No point,0
Don't offer to send notifications if you won't actually do it. That was the whole reason why I thought this would help me and it didn't. Will be uninstalling.,0
Very buggy first few times that I've used the app. Repeatedly having to close and reopen it for it to properly work.,0
"Needs a VPN if you're in China. Some questionable UI and design choices, though the fundamentals work well for the most part. If you want to do anything remotely interesting then you have to pay, of course. And the subscription fees are absolutely extortionate. One month is the same price as a month of Netflix and a year is £47. A year of MS Office 365 with all of its functionality is £60... Let that sink in. I don't understand why, for relatively little, this app costs so much. Greed, I assume.",0
"I subscribed premium however always have issues with syncing with Todolist servers. So my tasks disappeared, rearranged and completely messy. I spent almost an hour every day to arrange them again but next day they gone again. Please fix this.",0
Widget not loading?!?,0
Way too expensive for the premium features. While I don't mind paying for an app there are many other apps that track to-do items for far less money,0
Very basic calender. Outdated UI . Not possible to integrate with Google task or other task managers. Few functions for collaborative work . MOST DESIRED FEATURE of a calender is a ability to add events and add invites from other apps and emails and thats missing.,0
"latest update has not fixes bugs that occur every day.frustrating to use.sometimes it won't save,will just have a loading loop.Some basic things are not customizable like the calendar starting on Monday or the date format ,doesn't keep track of activity data correctly . Please focus on getting the app to work instead of focusing on superficial appearance! was thinking of paying for a subscription but what's the point if the money will not go towards making the app usable & less temperamental?",0
"yeah, this is not user-friendly. there should be some kind of tutorial, this is not the kind of app you can just jump in and start using, which is what I was hoping for.",0
Not very user friendly. Uninstalled immediately,0
"I love the idea of this app. Unfortunately, it is not super user friendly. I've been using it for over a month and it is not very obvious how to complete quests or anything else. (and yes, I have gone through the FAQs) I finally figured out how to hatch eggs, but that's all. It's a pretty clunky app as a ""game"" but it does a pretty good job of keeping me accountable for things. That's the only reason I haven't deleted it. As a ""Gamify your life"" app, I'm not convinced. Hopefully it improves!",0
24 hour mode is a PRO feature?!,0
Too hard to use. No tutorials make it worse,0
"This app is a pretty good one, but on my Galaxy Note, it stopped allowing me to check off tasks for some reason.  I paid for the pro version before this happened unfortunately.",0
"Great app that now has intrusive full screen ads, ugh",0
Reminders are behind a paywall,0
"Hi Developer. Need to improve note module. It fix only for protrait view, which is when I'm using landscape view (tablet with keyboard), I need to adjust my head or the gadget. TQ",0
Used to be 5 stars. I've used this app for years.... The sudden addition of full page unskipable adds ruined it. It looks like I'm not alone in my disappointment.,0
Too many errors.,0
I AM SPECIFICALLY LOOKING FOR A GAMIFIED PRODUCTIVITY APP. MY REVIEW OF YOURS WHICH IS VERY LACKING: Dark theme is missing! This one appears to be for 5 year olds! Can you make a NON-CHILD app similar to this but for REGULAR PEOPLE not 5 year old RPG gamers? I avoided yours for a long time but still nothing exists yet for adults. I hate RPG (cause I'm not an anti-social loser) but want to gamify my productivity with public leaderboards in an app. Thanks. Looks well made but I don't want it.,0
calendar sync for a productivity app is a pro only feature,0
"it was pretty good on my old phone. then when everything was ported to my new one, the app came, but not the lists I'd made. what's the point of that?! I've deleted it.",0
Doesn't work. Error messages appear everywhere when I open the app.,0
"The idea is wonderful. But a lot of tedious mistakes spoil the whole impression. For example, information is slowly updated even within the application, often clicking on a menu item is ignored. If you create a task without a title, but with a list, it will become closed for editing, just delete. Not all things are obvious. I had to read help to solve simple questions. Well, the old-school 8-bit graphics - not everyone likes it.",0
"When I saw that Dark Theme was premium only I stopped and uninstalled immediately. Frankly I was insulted. Are you hoping to squint me into submission? If I can't try your app comfortably then why bother? There are identical apps (I'm exploring now) that you're competing with, so think about making the app comfortable to use for free with restrictions I would pay to lift. It's like... youtube giving volume control only to premium members or test driving a new car without getting to use A/C.",0
"i like how its organized and how many choices and the customization. but, i set alarms and keep in mind, i have all permissions on, and it didnt go on my screen, so i missed a very important meeting.",0
"Would be nice if you could import tasks from other applications, but not only is that a problem, but importing from a previous version of Tasks is impossible too? Nevermind. I'll just stick to what I got.",0

"Not a stand alone app. Must use calendar on mobile, my pout was to use it on its own.",0
EDIT: Even just an option for the horizontal interface would be great! Thank you for taking my review into consideration! Please please please! Bring back the old horizontal interface. Or at least have an option for it. I used to absolutely love this app and would have rated it 5 stars anyday. But now I find it quite useless.. I understand how it could work for some people but it's definitely not working for everyone (as I've seen in other reviews).,0
"Looks great, alarms don't work. The notifications just don't work on my Motorola G7 plus running Android 9.",0
It's not Wunderlist. Took a good app and ruined it. Just opened it up (July 2020) no sync. Try later. Huh? Microsoft garbage?,0
No habits library,0
Was working fine before. . But it's not working now..not registering my events,0
Tried to put in my first event and it failed to log it. I uninstalled it same day.,0
otherwise the app is good but i bought the full version and did i exepet to get customization fratures atleast give to feature to mark different sectors with different colours... very disappointed ... you guys should consider making the user interface less complicated...,0
I HAVE THREE THINGS.. That's it 3 everyday Can't find a way You would think Microsoft would have an easy way for a user to get that into everyday. Some trick or easy way .. Nope So I looked for support and what I found was frequently asked questions that's it.. which were not helpful at all...THEN at the bottom of this it asked whether it's considerate of my time and does IT TIME stamping as if that was important you people are SO off the MARK. I,0
Confusing and clunky.,0
The app no longer reminds me of tasks and keeps bringing up ones marked complete.,0
This app doesn't work the way we won't. It doesn't notify after even permitting it.,0
Works well but free version only gives you three total lists,0
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub.",0
"Used to be good until last update, now I can't login to see any of my tasks, appointments, or notes.                                            Edit: Now works since newest update, but I have lost all previous tasks and notes. Very disappointed.",0
Great task app BUT it will auto reformat your typing and you can't stop it - this is a huge problem.,0

Please fixed it. Why i can't login my passcode. Damnly. Alot of doc i ve save inside,0
"I unistalled just for the costumer service. I was ready and willing to give the app a shot. But given the cruel, uncaring, and sarcastic responses to others who were unpleased with how the app works I will be uninstalling imediately.",0
Error issues are so much,0
Very buggy first few times that I've used the app. Repeatedly having to close and reopen it for it to properly work.,0
I'm sure the dev is well intended. Just no for me. UX is terrible.,0
"Don't install this app.This is forgery. I've used this app for more than 2 years when I changed my mobile phone I couldn't login when I logged in it says ""this email account is not in our database"" I have the mail to prove that I had had the account in the App.I mailed the company 4-5 times but there's no reply. 2 years of my habit data is lost.",0

Widget out of memory,0
"I should be able to use the app when offline, and the app should sync the changes whenever connected to the internet. It shouldn't force me to connect with the internet for ticking a checkbox!",0
"Not competent at scheduling. Recurring tasks are automatically ""completed"" if not checked by the scheduled time. There is no way to know if you missed it. The interface is pleasant though.",0

"The company has removed the feature that elevated the tool from others completely unannounced.

Wondeerful Wunderlist app closed down by the corporate US. Sad times.,0
"It is not syncing properly between my husband and I. In fact, it won't sync at all. It did in the beginning and now it just won't. Really miss wunderlist! It was simple, easy to use and it WORKED!",0
Reminders are behind a paywall,0
so far the app is great. would get 5 stars if it had a tabbing feature where you can side over to each task name instead of having to go to the menu button to switch.,0
"Pro version doesn't work correctly. I have more than one google account. 
App keeps ignoring account used for purchase and using other account. I 
have to delete gmail accounts for the app to recognize the account used for 
purchase and if I try to add the deleted accounts back the app starts to 
ignore the account used for purchase.",0
"I've had this app for years, even upgraded it to the premium version. Loved it.. then as the developers started updating, I started having many issues. Each time i used the app it would show in the premium or free version; it was inconsistent. I wrote the customer service for assistance and I didn't get any help. So i lived with it. Most recently, I started receiving ads after every entry; Not okay!! I sent another email 2 wks ago which they have not responded to; which is why I'm here. Help!",0
"I liked this app, even paid for it, but uninstalled it today due to weird behavior. I see two other reviews here with a similar problem. The app will periodically launch itself, but it's just a black screen, and it creates a copy of my home screen - looks the same but frozen until I hit the close button, then the copy scrolls away and I can again use my phone. Just odd.",0
"Used to be a great app though the most recent update has made the widget unusable. Too small to see and there is no way to change the size, you also can no longer select multiple tasks, or pop out the widget to see multiple days. I requested to go back to the previous version, but didn't get much response so now I'm looking for a replacement.",0
It stop working and I try to reinstall it but same problem,0
Repeated to do list do not appear on My day. I missed few. That option should have been there,0
"I used to like, even love this app. It was great. Now though, every time I add an event on my calendar an ad comes up and stays there until it is finished. It's awful! So far the ads have not been inappropriate, just annoying. I don't think that going to the pro version would fix this. I don't even know how to find the pro version to purchase as it doesn't show up in the play store. Super frustrating. I don't want to find another app. I just want this one to work without the silly ads.",0
Bring back Wunderlist! I was using this to coordinate to-dos and such with my girlfriend after having used Wunderlist for months. The lists refuse to sync up properly. We constantly have two different lists going on. Very disappointing.,0
This app is absolutely nice app but problem with this app is it shows app stopped after some use and this happened every time with this app only don't know why ?,0
the current day shows events for the next day and seemingly no option to change it. very annoying.,0
I have an error that makes me unable to sync due to a connection error though clearly I am connected to the internet. I am a premium user. The app is great but please help me with my problem. I'm tired of taking screenshots of all my pages every week as my remedy for the sync error.,0
"U should work on the phones like oppo and others so that customer don't

Cannot get it to work on my Huawei P20. I have tried 3 times and cannot get it to sign in. It looks like it works fine on my iPad because I can sign up and get in but on my phone I am unable to do either. I needed something that I could use on both devices but am unable to get into in ob my phone,0
"Really beautiful and great idea. It is unfortunate for anyone who doesn't buy into all things Google and don't use Google Callander.

Just playing with the demo showed me the power of this style.",0
"Dear developers, thank you for deleting all my reminders after updating the app! It was not pleasant at all, believe me!",0
"Nice interface and it syncs across my devices. However the widget constantly crashes on both, P30 Pro, Oneplus 7T Pro.",0
"Almost what i need, except there's no option to set a start & end time with reminder for the start. So it's useless (for me).",0
Have have to make an account in order to use this app. There is no way around it.,0
"2018-11-19 -it seems useful, but it crashes on my phone 3 - 15 times a day. 2019-04-13 - No update, this app would be great if it didn't crash just about every time I go to my home screen from *anywhere*. Also there have been no update, and no responses to the roughly 75 - 100 error logs that I have submitted. I paid $5.00 (US) for a ""life time subscription"" to the premium version. DO NOT SPEND YOUR MONEY !!!!!!",0
Does not show reminders,0
"Liked the prioritization by dragging and the highlighting, but there does not seem to be a way to create recurring tasks. That's a deal -breaker for me. I'm uninstalling",0
Couldn't get past registration/login. I've never used the app before but when I tried to make an account it said that my email has been taken and when I went to login it just kept loading forever.,0
After a week my tasks never showed up. Completely stopped working 👍,0
"A few months ago it started to fail to sync with my employer Exchange server. I used to make it work manually, but now it doesn't work even if I ""sync now"".",0
Nothing special. just a calendar app. not worth the time it takes to set up. clunky at best. poor layout. minimal instructions. not intuitive to use,0
"Updates have shifted to taking *away* features. You can no longer format text in sections and project names, as someone at Todoist decided that was ""simpler."" I'm 90% done switching to Notion and don't regret it one bit.",0
Uninstalled within 10 minutes of confusion. What to set where. Not user friendly. Not able to set routines daily programmes. Very confusing settings.,0
This is by far the best To-Do app. I gave it 2 stars because it enforces us to use Microsoft Account for sharing the lists.,0
It is very awkward cauz you need to give it a proper plan,0
"App broken, don't bother. Like many many other reviewers, this app is totally broken and defunct on Android devices and specifically Galaxy S10 / Note 10 devices. It seems the developer response to all of those reviews is ""please report a bug"" but this has now been an issue for months that they haven't looked into fixing despite dozens of notifications from users that their app is broken. I have instead now downloaded an app by another developer which actually works. I will not be back.",0
"muito limitador pra quem não paga pra usa, e nem é tão vom assim.",0
used it awhile ago and recently installed on my new phone. as soon as it opened it was clear i would not be able to use it. several things where off (like trying to put pictures in an office doc) worse still when i try to add many options are cut off by some form of white box that sits in the way. unfortunately dailies are one of the missing options and a huge part of how i personally used the app.,0
"Desktop and web version is slow, awkward, and useless. App for phone is good. As soon as I have time, I will switch to something else. Makes me miss Wunderlist",0
Suddenly it stopped working and it really disappointed me ... i was not able to take it anymore... after planting 13 trees on a single day I'm so sad that all my coin collection got lost...,0
Anything beyond keeping a simple list (including reminders) is paid,0
"2019/10/24 - revised from 5 to 1 star. App is dead. All my data gone. Never again trust an app you cannot export and organize your data, and to a universal format. Avoid as others said recently.",0
The one thing that made this app better than the others was that it was ad free. Uninstalling.,0
"This is just a re-skinned Samsung calendar, don't waste your time",0
"Calendar is a premium feature, making this pointless without a subscription.",0
It would be better if there are more options for customising the avatar and theme which is in purple. You will need to spend money for a decent background. The avatar is pixelated and doesn't look good. Getting a bit bored of it now.,0
"I don't use the free version, I like to pay for software that deserves it. I tapped on the app today and had an interstitial ad. Do not do this again for a business app.",0
Recurring reminders feature is not available. Let's say I want to do a particular task every day and want to have a reminder daily. I tried for it using this app but it does not work.,0
"Seems OK. It was not made obvious that you have to pay to get unlimited habits, so was a waste of my time.",0
Really disappointed with the full screen adverts now taking over this otherwise great app. Will be uninstalling and choosing another alternative app (there are plenty) big mistake by the developer!,0
"Need to about to change the Events colors thank you, other setting has the color plate to select, why is the Events that controlling the whloe widget background but only having 16 colors? And it doesn't shows the color that I chosen... they are not the same color, the magenta shows up light purple... not matching with my phone setting... and my widgets, and I hope there has a setting that can one click and the whole app color hue would be the color I like or choose, I don't like blue.",0
"It sorely needs and UNDO (& backup/restore/revert) feature in case we accidentally touch/swipe a circle/bullet which then gets unintentionally deleted immediately (which I find incredibly frustrating). (It also needs a flexible feature to import & export other common text/data formats like CSV, XML, events to & from calendar… not just copy reminders to tasks) If Google fixes all that then I'd give it 5-stars!",0
First I liked the free version but after a while it got annoying with all the advertisements,0
😶😶😶😶,0
"It's the worst app ever, doesn't give any reminder doesn't work ..... Just a waste of time!!!!! 👎👎👎👎",0
I don't really liked it much . Waste of intenet.,0
"Bare Bones. Integrations are a lie. You have to use a third party app to make it work and Zapier is garbage. Grocery list is kind of cool. Calendar has that annoying Apple style slide that hides evens and is impossible to read instead of traditional blocks. Support button is for bug fixes only, so premium support is also a lie.",0
"Poor widget options, which is what I needed most. Very space inefficient and not customizable at all. Disappointing. Todoist had the most compact and useful widget, followed by Microsoft ToDo.",0
Nic,0
"bought premium version, didn't get upgrade, sent proof of payment, still no response. not good",0
At first I liked that I could choose to see or hide the done tasks and even the done tasks were on alphabetic order. I use this app also as a grocery list. So every time I want to add the done tasks I have to go throw everything. Why can't you have the done tasks in alphabetic order as well. Or that we could choose between this interface and the previous one ourselves. The way it is now (chaotic) it is very user unfriendly and time consuming.,0
"Hey todoist! Why are you todoing this to me!? First you put these silly little checkmarks on my tasks that are 100% in my way (leftys are people too). I keep unintentionally deleting tasks and having to dig through my completed items to restore them. That's annoying! Now this latest update, you've taken away subgroups? Subgroups are part of the entire project. Having an overall view of all subs within a group is convenient. Having to flip from sub to sub is illogical. I just don't get it!",0
Very buggy and doesn't always show whole pages or lists.,0
Completely broken for synch. Wunderlist actually worked. This is a disaster.,0
"I agree with a previous user that recent updates are making the app worse. I've used this app for several years and loved that my to-do list syncs across devices, but recent changes (specifically, deleting completed tasks instead of leaving them visible/able to be restored, despite modifying settings) make this app basically useless for my purposes. I'm disappointed that I need to find a new app after so long using this one.",0
It disturbs when they send unnecessary e-mails,0
"I had thought this was wonderful. Not perfect, but definitely 4 1/2 stars. Recently, it's begun messing with my Samsung Galaxy Note 8 System UI, that must be force closed in order to move on. I've turned notifications off, which defeats most of the purpose, but am still using the app. If I'm able to determine that it wasn't this app, I'll update my review.",0
I tried buying gems but it doesn't look like I got the gems.... But my balance in the Google pay thing has gone down. Last time I throw away money on this app. Update: the gems showed up the following day. Not sure if that's because I emailed them about it or just it took several hours to go through.,0
Twice lost all data b/c wouldn't sync. Had over a year of data. Had premium and still didn't make a difference. Moving on. Just done. So upset!,0
"App is very good for what it is, but the sync feature stopped working for me. The FAQ says it's due to a rooted phone but this happened twice on non-rooted phones. HabitBull offers no support to fix. 2 stars bec it works standalone, but if you need syncing know there's a risk of permanent failure.",0
uninstalled once i realized there are ads and it wipes your current Google calendar.,0
"Getting annoying, reminder keep jumping out although the task is set one month later. Start Looking for alternatives",0
Got a new tablet which sync my notes fine after I uninstalled and signed back in. My new phone won't sync. On the app for my phone there is no place to sign out! Frustrating,0
Crashes at start.,0
App keeps crashing,0
The app was last updated on 2018. Looks like the devs abandoned it. I've been having trouble with reminders (a key feature of the app) but haven't heard back from the devs. :/,0
"I really like this app. Enough to purchase the premium a few years back, but the app didn't update to premium for me, and there was no response when I contacted the support. Seems like I'm not alone in this experience. Don't put your trust in the developers!",0
"Not very easy to use. You can figure it out after you play with it long enough, but over all, not very intuitive.",0
It says you are downloading the pro version which is a complete lie.,0
Amazingly useful app with horrible glitches every week when all checked tasks become undone and overdue and default calendar changed by itself.,0

Price is very high for Indian users. We don't get 1/10 of what a US citizen gets paid here so there app subscriptions at such prices don't make a sense.,0
app looks good but does not notify me on my oppo. i foloowed the instructions to fix this however they are outdated so i cannot fix this problem.,0
Failed to arrange my tasks by dragging them as used to do with Wunderlist,0
Would love this to work. It says it is working (ticks against my Google calendars). Shows a few. Doesn't show most. Disappointing.,0
App has stopped opening,0
"I paid for premium, then followed (twice) every single instruction in the FAQ section regarding how to sync data between devices. Syncing did not work. I wasted 2 hours of my day trying to get this app to work.",0
Cannot log in on other devices.,0
"YOUR CONDESCENDING ATTITUDE IS NOT HELPING YOR CASE. There is a sublist reorder but NOTHING for the MAIN LIST. THERE IS NO SORT OF ANY KIND says sort by DO DATE or lets you PICK WHAT TO SORT BY, A LOGIC CHOICE. Completed tasks NEED TO CHANGE IMIEDIATELY so you KNOW IT'S COMPLETED & next month IS SET. I DIDN'T SAY IT WASN'T SIMPLE. The INTERFACE is NOT VERY INTUITIVE. I DID LOOK AT HELP & THERE is LITTLE FOR THE MAIN LIST. YOU ARE very IRRITATING so I am going to try other choices.",0
"TD;DR You have to register. You get blasted with emails. Free version is as good as free native app. It's not clear what features you get if you spend money. It's disappointing. Most features are behind a pay wall (which is fine) - I'd be more than happy to pay if I understood what those features are and having used the app, I still don't know. Also you HAVE to register with them and as soon as you do you get blasted with emails, which is by far the most annoying thing this app does.",0
Not Working On Xperia E1!,0
"I am using this app for years, premium version. Until now was working fine but for a month or so the sync between mobile and desktop client is not working so the app is useless for me now. Wrote to support without any reaction. Don't recommend.",0
"I quite like habitica, but this app has some issues. The biggest problem for me is that switching the to do list to ""Scheduled"" is supposed to sort the to do items by due date (that's how it works on the website), but it doesn't. That makes the to do list (in the app) useless for me.",0
"Came back to see if I can use the app since I do like it, it's a great idea. I'm my case: I need to be able to add calendar events, reminders in one app 100% essential and afaik this isn't supported? I have a shared gcal, a personal and another work one and all of them needs to not only show up for me to organize life itself. They also need to be managed in the app I use for reminders etc for this to do what it needs for me. Not just reminders, calendar events needs add, edit. Back to any.do",0
"i love this app but it reads my texts. i left one in draft and it suggested it as a Todo item. i couldn't find any way to get it to keep is ""eyes"" to itself. not about it.",0
the User Interface makes no sense,0
Thr notion of paying a monthly fee for this is laughable. I will stick with Todoist for a fre more bucks a month.,0
why you changed layout to old one..its really bad and annoying.,0
I was looking for a class schedule app and this was not it,0
"I really want to use this app, but on my Galaxy S10, the first 2 of the 3 slides in the introduction before logging in, are blank. The character visuals on the character customization are invisible, and on the settings menu, I scroll down and the options start to overlap each other (hard to describe). I will consider reinstalling after the graphical issues are fixed because it seems like a great app, but currently it's unusable for me.",0
le partage est tres nul.... cest juste un texte envoyé a l autre...,0
Looks like a pretty good app but it doesn't sync with Alexa. Which is the main reason I installed it. Shouldn't be this difficult.,0
Good ideas but not well implemented. It gets tedious and boring after a while.,0
Started off really well but has stopped working properly now. Great shame as it has a lot of promise.,0
"- Can't have more than 150 tasks per project, even of you pay. - Can't have more than a couple a certain number of projects, even if you pay. - Sharing from chrome and hitting the ""paper airplane"" button on the keyboard instead of the app dialog freezes todoist and chome :( :( :(",0
"Would love to actually get started with this app, but for whatever reason I can't even build my avatar. None of the options for selecting what I want my avatar to look like actually show up on the screen, they're all completely invisible.",0
Had high hopes for this because it had everything I wanted but the completed tasks that I keep putting as completed come back the next day which is just irritating. Have tried all the settings to get of it but I can't and can't be bothered to persevere anymore,0
"Doesn't work on my ASUS ZenFone 5 (ZE620KL) It doesn't show up whenever I 
add the widget in my home screen.",0
"Seems pretty fancy, but $32 a year for reminders when most competing apps offer that as a basic feature for free??? For a to do list app??? Yeah no thanks.",0
The app used to work perfectly now it lets me do anything without the tree dying I apologize for two stars but the problem is very annoying,0
"Great app in the beginning. But once you start skipping days, the notifications become insulting shaming words. For example, calling me a couch potato. Which I am not. So dumb. What expert would ever say that insults are motivational? Almost none. I'd rather use an app based on the principle of kindness, not shaming.",0
"NOT a fan of the new permission requirements. I've never had any problem with the app detecting whether I've left it, and shouldn't have to give you access to my notifications for the app to do the same job as always. Right now it's basically just a fancy timer. EDIT AS RESPONSE: I get that, but was it really necessary to make that mandatory for anyone, even users who had no problem before? Regarding data use, the only thing I can do is take your word for it (as with any company, but still).",0
calendar sync for a productivity app is a pro only feature,0
Did not like this at all. Difficult to sync with all my different calendars and limited formatting and design options as well. Also hard to unsubscribe. Very round about process. I do not recommend this.,0
"There's a bug with the planning view, you can't see the title of the event. Other than that the app runs okay.",0
"Seems to have glitched out on me. When I put in my username and display name, it gave me an error saying ""Path Profile.Name Required."" Then none of the Avatar customization options appeared. I wasn't even able to start the third page when the app crashed. Reopening the app took me to the Dailies tutorial and now I'm sure I'm missing something. I have a Samsung Galaxy Note 10.",0
"This last update has brought all kinds of bugs. Lists disappearing randomly, lists getting renamed, permissions randomly getting changed. All of these problems indicated serious bugs in the data model and potentially spillage of customer data. I would suggest looking into a new tasks app because the drop in quality has been dramatic.",0
I just needed a single program where I can can you record my voice notes,0
"This is one of the best apps, one of the best features is that it announces the activity name...... Edit: Hi, the app was doing well! And was planning to buy the paid version. But i am getting errors with background tasks not refreshing, and today due to that error, i lost all the events scheduled which were scheduled for today. Can you advise please?",0
Always getting hanged.Not opening.,0
Problem with login,0
Subscription only. No outright purchase. Too bad. Seems like a nice app.,0
Poor,0
"It's just okay, it's too easy to delete tasks on accident and it puts it in backwards",0
I just removed this app! I missed several events in the last couple of months because it did not notify me!!!!!,0
"When I'm plying video on another app which is in whitelist, then my plant die 🤔🤔😭😭",0
Complexity and unavailability of useful feature for free kill the interest. Atleast widget should be available for trials.,0
"App is very buggy ! Week view is completely unusable - shows some events twice, and some not at all.  Also, it would be nice if there was an option, in month view, to see the names of the events without having to click on every day individually.  Fix this and you'll get 5 stars, but without that (especially week view!) the app is useless.",0
"Extremely Disappointed. I had been a faithful user of this app and loved it. Then all of sudden everything changed. There is no cloud support. The tabs option is gone. There is no interface with established tasks list. I have tried and tried to use. I contacted support and they replied that due to streamlining the app it has a completely new appearance. I had uninstalled this app, however I felt I needed to write thos review. After I finish this, uninstalling this app. Useless to me.",0
"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all.",0
Too many bugs and shortcomings to warrant the subscription cost imo. There are some great free todo apps as well which give you additional features over todoist free version.,0
better than Google calendar but has bugs/for example it keeps restoring deleted events after i delete them/i cleared cache memo and restarted phone/useless/still the same banana. update/yes i did remove Gmail account but no use/it seems a bug between localhost and oppo accounts as it shows both colors for the same birthday/btw i tested removing oppo account or localhost then i get a bug free part of the calendar but it bugs again after that part. update/yes 2 entries but for a certain period.,0

"Notifications don't work. It's a shame, because I wanted to buy a subscription. [EDIT] Okay, I already know what's going on. The operating system of my smartphone is MIUI. This app's notifications work when the battery saver mode is turned off. At the same time, in the application settings I have the option: ""No restrictions - battery saver doesn't restrict app's activity."" Other applications similar to this one (ToDo, habits) work with this option and at the same time enable battery saving.",0
"The app itself is really nice. I like how the widget displays my schedule for the day, it.gives me a very nice grasp of my time. The bad thing is that it slows down my smartphone, I have a S9, and it drains a lot of battery. It makes my phone lag and ""stutter"" when I try to open it. I uninstalled ans reinstalled apps to check my theories, so I uninstalled this one, the phone was doing so much better. And I even PAID for the Pro version!!!",0
"the application is very nive but cant take the complete use of it because of the premium option , and the amount also is high",0
Very poor application.... Repeating reminder not working...useless app,0
"I have been using this app, this is just one gorgeous 'stay focused ' app, but at times when I want the app to open it shows stopped and I have to reinstall.",1
"When I had an iPhone, I used the built in Reminder app relatively heavily to keep track of things I have to get done soon, remember something new to be done daily, or to break down a major side project into sub-tasks. Ever get a random idea and think ""shoot, I gotta try that"", just to forget it the next day. Put down a line item in this app. You may forget, but this app won't!!!",1

"Enjoying it so far, can't wait to see future updates. I am using it as a supplement to my calendar app and it works perfectly. Bought the pro version immediately after installing the free version because I was so impressed with how functional it is.",1
Very good😛👍,1
"Excellent for to do lists, managing projects and tracking habits. I like the ability to have transparent widgets too.",1
"I would have reported this as a bug within the app, but I found another bug when trying to do that. First one: when submitting a bug or feedback, it does not pass through the 'To' address into the email, so I'm not sure where to send it to. Second one: when editing a habit, daily or to-do text field, the keyboard pops up and disappears. A workaround on this (for my device) is to rotate the phone landscape. Using pixel 3. Otherwise, a very good app!",1
Awesome app. It really helps me keep my focus. There are ads but the app is well worth them.,1
"I love this app so much. This is the app that I search for a long time. BUT, the widget sometimes error. It show the tasks that already checked being unchecked. When I clicked it, the app just show white screen or freezing. After several minutes, it became normal again. Even though it will be normal again, of course that's so annoying! When I'm in rush to create task, the freeze often makes me forget about the things that I want to write. Please, fix this! Thank you.",1
"Better than MS To Do. Almost as good as Wunderlist. Only thing missing is the gratifying ""ding"" sound when checking things off.",1
Helps a lot in reminding of tasks to be done on daily basis.,1
Love it. I'm self employed with several appointments a day. Being able to see my appointments at a quick glance is really helpful and a must for me.,1
"The best time management app 3 years using it and it keeps me organised,efficient and productive.",1
Like it,1
Great app and very helpful for my use,1
I have some suggestions to make this great app better 1. Be able to see the hourly breakdown of all your tags 2. Choose which tag to allocate to your study session before starting the session,1
"This app is great , I mean really it is.. you can do a lot of things but only if you pay which isn't a bad thing , it's just that as a student adding this to my expenses is just not feasible ... Hence the 4 stars , connecting to a student service such as UniDays would increase influx of student users.",1
After reading Reality Is Broken a couple of years ago I have tried every app out there to gamify my life and nothing has really cut it. I preferred filling in hand drawn skill boxes on a whiteboard! Until now! This is the one! I love it! Thank you so much!,1
"Great app! Love the daily reminders! Super easy to use!! I wish that you could do more than 5 habits without paying, but hey, Im cheap and developers deserve to be paid!!",1
Really useful and well designed app - only thing I feel that is missing to make it five stars is having a shopping list widget,1
"EDITED - read second paragraph. Hi, not sure if I'm missing out a setting but the app does not display all the events in a day. It makes sense to show only the events in a 12 hr time frame on the clock face, but the list of events should include all tasks of the day -- instead of us having to ""fast forward"" the day until the events appear. I did not mean ""tasks"", poor choice of words on my part. I meant that if I have an event at 9pm today, and the time now is 6am, I will not see this at all. The clock face only shows 12 hrs: this makes sense. The list of events below the clock should probably show events for the whole day, though.",1
Good Android widget: 👉For watching planned schedules everytime at ease on the home screen. 👉 For syncing all calenders to view birthdays & events at one place.,1
"The app is really great and don't even need the paid version. Unlike what people said, I found it quite easy to set up. I wish the ""custom repeat"" had option to choose which day of the week and not the frequency of days, as my schedule varies (schema as : 4 days A followed by 3 days B). I really love the widget option also. I just downloaded it but if I keep using it then I will consider buying the pro version to support the creators.",1
I like it but wish I could add a friend to the list so we can edit together,1
Good job,1
"Excellent, very useful with a smooth powerful and intuitive interface. It's a must to keep my daily tasks on track",1
it is very nice game for studying,1
"I've been using this app for some weeks now. There are still some features that I don't understand and there's just so much available for customisation that it's overwhelming. But, once i spent a few hours customizing all i wanted, this app has been so fun and useful. Most to do list apps out there are so cumbersome and anxiety inducing. This one isn't. It has helped me prioritize what's important to me while letting me role-play. I like it a lot.",1
"Best watch once you understand it. It takes a while to set up just the way you want it and to actually ""get it"", but once you do it does exactly what it promises. Its sleek yet informative and by far the best ""at a glance"" app for your homescreen. The watch addon is the cherry on the cake. Only improvement in my opinion would be to add multiple different widgets. Like give me the option for a small simple one on my home screen and a bigger more detailed one on my office screen for instance.",1
Es muy practitica y fácil de usar,1

"Love, love, love this app!! I have been a paper planner lover for 30 years and I just switched to Artful Agenda and I couldn't be more pleased. Try it, you'll love it!!!",1
Works great most of the time however crashes when making my display size small. Google pixel. Recurring error.,1
"This app looks great and most of the functions seem to be very practical. There isn't any Windows or browser-based version for usage on a computer, is it? If not, is something in planning? As Wunderlist will be shut down, I'm in search for a good alternative, and this app WITH a sync function would be amazing! Edit: Showing the calendar view in a widget would be fantastic as well.",1
"It's a fabulous app for focused concentration onto a task. It's smooth and has everything you may ask for. The background music theme is pretty nice. App crashed way too frequently earlier, there was an issue with a phone makers update. Resolved .",1
"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work.",1
Overall good but please bring back Smart Dates and Notification Counter,1
"Brilliant app, Easy to use , practical for anyone who need to make an order in your personal life, business etc.",1
Nice game but it makes me feel like l have FOMO on my favourite apps 😒😒😒😒😒😟😟😟🙁🙁🙁☹☹☹,1
Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better,1
So far so good! Great app!,1
"It's terrific. So flexible. So organized. Wish it had a web app, but that is the only drawback.",1
Ignore battery optimization is always turning off automatically without using the app for long time,1
I'm using the app very often and it's very helpful for productive use of time . But I'm troubled with installing the app repeatedly as it won't open after certain time period from installed moment .,1
very well,1
Love this,1
Love this app it's super great to manage your time and make the most of your day.. best thing for me about this app is the fact that it has pop-up notification to remind me of what I have to do! Love love LOVE IT!!,1
"Amazing app to help you complete focused work without falling into distractions. You plant virtual trees and get coins when they grow up. You can accumulate the coins and exchange them for either new types of virtual trees or to plant ACTUAL ones. So, not only it helps you in being more productive. But also, it lets you contribute to the environment.",1
Love this app. Posts on my home screen ( with a widget) so I see my appointments at all times. Easy to use..,1
Excellent app.,1
"Not very expressive frame for activity descriptions, must be in the first stages of development. Guilds look incredible diverse, very surprising it is a social app. Seems the leveling function is standard gaming and well embedded. Hope open sourcing it make it better fit. Passing habits to to-do would be desirable.",1
Enjoying it,1
"I love it. I'm like playing a game w/o using my phone but if you think about it, I'm actually playing a game using my phone!",1
Please give us more background pictures . Overall this app is better than any To-Do list app present in play store.,1
"Stable.Works on Android ,PC and Apple devices",1
Excellent and minimal to no ads,1
"This initially looks a bit confusing. However, this design actually functions extremely well. The way it can act as both a clock, date, alarm and agenda widget at the same time is just incredibly efficient. It also provides you with a very easy way to evaluate at which times of the day you have events and more importantly: when you have breaks and how long they are. All this at a glance, compared to clunky agenda widgets where you have to sit and calculate it in your head. Well worth the money!",1
The app really nice.....i request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders,1
"Getting into it, following the mechanics and I feel motivated to do ans comolete stuff to earn Exp. I haven't used it much but I'm satisfied already. One small thing I can't choose to wear no glasses and I believe this is an unintentional error.",1
Looking forward to a better UI/UX. Will keep using it.,1
Great tool for coordinating between family members! I love being able to share lists so everyone is on the same page.,1
It is what I have looked for for some time. I wish it could sync'd across multiple devices.,1
Love the look of this agenda. List feature is great way to track & complete to do lists!,1
"Good at organizing tasks. The ""Highlight"" feature (and more importantly the ability to filter only highlighted entries) is great for managing to-do items.",1
"I live by my to-do lists, and this app has by far been the best I've found to create and organize them. I *really* wish, though, that there was a desktop version of this app as well, so I could manage my lists both on my phone and on my computer.",1
"It's cute, but the fact that I cannot view a calendar with my progress kills it for me. I am going to stick to Loop app.",1
I give it 4 stars but needs main edits: 1. There got to be alerts to remind one of the activity.. not just notifications. 2. Widget should be on lock screen beside being on the home screen. 3. This app can have the option of overcoming or controlling other apps; as to prevent distraction of following the routine.,1
"I really like the app, love my forest and stay at a higher level of concentration. But I apparently reached the limit of real-trees, which is only 5 and way too low! Otherwise a 5 Star experience!",1
Well it works for me. Seem to be keeping up with my habit. Slowly introducing a new habit every 2-4 weeks and building up my habits.,1
"Such an awesome app♥️....one thing I would like to suggest is, please add some features like checklist and all, so it can show how much discipline I was as performance on graph.",1
Ol,1
good,1
"Absolutely loving electronic planner. I've been looking for something that fits what I need for AGES and once it has recurring tasks,it will have everything I need 😍 I've contacted support a few times and the response is really quick and resolves queries at first attempt.",1
Great app. Love that it links to my Google calendar.,1
It keeps reminding me even after the Task is done and it was adjusted according to how many times I should be notified. But overall nice app.,1
It was amazing,1
only 5 hapits for free,1
"This app is very helpful for me, because I use a system called GTD, and I can use that system in this app, I'm very grateful",1
Great concept to display to do list on a watch,1
Its good and does the job,1
"So I love this app- I think it's perfect for what I needed, at the time. Sadly my job changed and so did my need for a calendar/planner. Artful Agenda was still great but I found myself no longer using the stickers or really having time to add information to it. I canceled my subscription- they were super easy to work with. I still recommend this app to girls when asked - ❤❤ I love and miss Artful agenda. When my job changes again I'll be back.",1
Nice app. But can update a function such as we can add in an attachment(like photo) into the task or etc will be better,1
Improves productivity,1
I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks,1
This is most probably the best reminder app in android. I am using it for last couple of years after trying so many apps. I just love the widgets and the ad-less experience. I use it daily to manage my work. The reminder pop up is really helpful. Thank you developers.,1
Very good quality app for habits,1
Very simple and easy to use.,1
"Fantastic app! I travel frequently for business, and it always felt like every time that I would get to my hotel, I would find something that I had forgotten (forgot to pack clothes once, still not sure how I managed that). This app has been a lifesaver! It's so easy to add items, highlight priority items, check them off, and clear the list for my next trip. It's so visually pleasing too, I love being able to color code my lists. I would definitely give more than 5 stars if I could.",1
Easy to use and keeps me on top of urgent tasks. Have mine set up as a widget and easy to see what I have to do each day. Works really well for the features I use in the free version.,1
"The latest update has a bug, when holding the top task to drag it down it won't let me do it. I can drag any task but not the first one.",1
"Best app for planning out your days/week. Simply amazing! Also, I think a little tutorial at the beginning might be useful, so that the user would understand how everything works! (In fact I had some troubles understanding how to use the tags and set a routine lol) but after a while you will understand everything, and realize how simple and wonderful this app is! Thank you Edit: I totally missed the ""Help"" button where the tutorial is indeed present! Sorry :)",1
"Been using TickTick for three years now, and the mix of simplicity in use combined with the ability to track tasks and projects at a detail level, is perfect for me. The developer consistently updates the app with increased functionality and hones ease of use as well.",1
"Loving the app so far and has helped me stay on track with some chores and. My v small complaint is that the date is expressed wrong (for 90% of the world) as mm/dd/yy, wish I could change to dd/mm/yy, any way to change that setting on the horizon?",1
"This app is amazing except for one problem. When I got the premium version, most of my progress was erased! I'm glad some of it remained, but I worked for so long on that! Can you do something to fix that? Thanks.",1
Exactly what I was looking for. This app really helps me keep track of my habits and it super user friendly. Love it!,1
Awesome reminder,1
Been looking for an app like this for a while! I love being able to coordinate things with 'tags' customizable by colours AND icons! I would happily give 5 stars apart from three things: 1. It would be great if there was an option to mark tasks as 'completed'; 2. I don't see much of a difference between the 'time block' and 'routine' choices (generally just looking for advice on this one); and 3. It would be great if we could add more than 3 tags to a time block or routine! 😊,1
"Very nice. Takes effort to customize, but can be a useful tool.",1
"Excellent app and honestly my life would be so disorganised without it. Really helps me to stay on track. My only request would be to give me greater control over when events repeat than the current setup of every day, week, 2 weeks, etc. (E.g. Allow me to repeat events on weekdays or even better specific days. Like Mondays and Wednesdays for instance.) Otherwise the app is sublime. If this small detail is added then I see no reason to withhold my 5 start reading from you. Great app.",1
Great help! It actually replaced the little papers + pens...,1
Loving it...,1
5 stars*,1
User friendly. Great GUI. No bugs so far. Great app.,1
Easy and simple.,1
Decent job replacing my beloved Wunderlist. Thanks for implementing most of the useful features that I loved in Wunderlist!,1
Been using the app for a couple of weeks and have lost 4lbs already. Took a bit of setting up with the tasks and rewards but it is very customisable. Gamifying my life might be just the thing I need to get into better habits and lose some weight!,1
"Very good app. The only note is that it takes a while to make it syncronizing properly. But after you get it, works like a charm.",1
"This is a great to-do list app. However, the competition offers a lot of features for free which are premium here. This app should offer atleast reminder functionality for free. Maybe they can limit the amount of reminders and projects that you can get in the free version which might make it a compelling app. Right now, in the free version, you can just create lists and projects which are viewable in the widgets, but a reminder should be there even in the basic version.",1
"It's great so far. I can only set 5 goals on the free version, but to be honest, any more than that and I'd be doomed to fail anyway! love that you can see the chain of days you've achieved your goals - I hate breaking that streak! The charts and graphs down the bottom also offer a nice visualization of your success which I really like too. The ability to set reminders for each habit is also good as it can give you the extra kick you need.",1
It's a neat idea and I've I tweeked the display settings I was able to make it easier to read. There are some features that could be explained better though. overall it's a interesting way to see what's on your schedule.,1
Cute app. Could do with a more user-easy interface for the lazy out there but nice little motivator,1
It is so good app I like it so much,1
Great app. Pulls together lots of info that keeps me in-the-know and sane.,1
Best task management app ever. Would love if it notes taking capabilities are also added.,1
"I love it, simple and effective! Is it right that the motivational pics don't switch anymore? Mine has been stuck on the very same for a year now :(",1
"Great APP! Detailed yet concise (with only the information I need). Amazingly, it is packaged together with one APP so effectively.",1
"Best! experienced real improvement in focused time. , Highly recommended for study and focused work.",1
"I like: * the way it separates lists (""sub lists"") horizontally, and I can switch between them conveniently with swipes, though I tend to accidentally delete tasks when trying to switch lists * I value the convenience of swipe to delete the most * being able to quick add tasks from the main screen, removes one extra tap step * being able to highlight important tasks, but wish it would automatically pin them to the top. Feature I wish most for: Image attachments. Idea: Location-based reminders?",1
Great.. and i liked it more than todoist..,1
"My Planner system is now complete! I love the web app and now with the mobile app, my on-the -go planning is also on point. The app is fast, beautiful and a perfect planning companion. Awesome!",1
"Hey, awesome app. It wasn't long until I purchased the unlocked version. However, some things could be improved. For example, you can't change units after the habit is created. And it would be nice to hide the "".0"" part after digits, since mostly it refers to ""minutes"" or ""iterations"" or ""cups"" and it looks kinda sloppy to see your goal described as ""Learn at least 30.0 minutes"" or ""Drink at least 2.0 cups"". If the number is whole, why not just hide that point zero - it'll look neater, I think.",1
good app...but they could add something like notification bar tab or floating widget or something so as to remind us constantly to keep us in check in order to develop out habits,1
Useful as all can add even when one person is at the shops it comes through with updates,1
I use the free version for a few years now. Very convenient to ise. No need to save anything. Every change you make is saved automatically. You can set priority for everything and categories tasks.,1
This app actually made me want to stick to my habits. The money/exp system is kind of broken and arbitrary. Fun way to think about your habits as life skills and the more you do it the better you get at it.,1
great for use,1
"Helps me alot with daily work and sets a time to time pie of what needs to be done , therefore helping people to begin a routine. Best part it syncs with Google Calendar, you can change colours of sections, make it a home screen widget, change opacity of the widget, etc. Must try this app to keep track of daily schedule.",1
"I really like the planner, it helps me achieve my tasks, goals & have an avenue to scribe my ideas down. Double thumbs up!",1
good,1
Do i need to pay?,1
"Good little to do app, but, how can you activate the sync feature ??",1
I started with the subscription primarily because of the NLP. Does it support recurring tasks with NLP ? The integrations are awsome!,1
"My life seems to be taking a roadless travelled, I love it.",1
Useful but still needs more integration to Outlook ... I'd like to load my colour categories that I already have in outlook calendar in my visualization. Calendar by week numbers is also a must have ... I'd like to know also the percentage of availability of each day based on my events. It could also integrate with my alarm in order to know at what time I wake up ... and so on. The potential of this app is huge,1
"(+)Pros: it's fun, LOTS of customisation, ALL basic functionality are free, inclined to habit generation than everyday to do list. (-)Cons: first time setup are quite challenging; literally create your own system. Icons & themes are limited (minor inconvenience). I was using LifeRPG (which seems abandoned now) so it helps with the learning curve. I see devs made lots improvement here. Recommended!",1
"This app is amazing it has (mostly) all the nessary tools.Though to make this even better you can include a timer. An include it on your wallpaper , otherwise it is a really good app for everyone",1
"Really beneficial, it allows me to follow my routines efficiently",1
🥰🥰 it is a good app,1
Routine tasks if not finished are shown as an overdue....!! Please give an option to auto mark any specific routine tasks as incomplete rather than overdue....!!,1
I want to say just add on the feature to check the box/things which i have done from my daily time boxing schedule,1
Very good application. Syncs well across devices and is reliable for intense use. Would like to see some evolution of the app from this point such as: #. Improved handling using keystrokes for speed #. Font resizing #. Add 'Yesterday' to 'Today' #. Bulk updates #. Time selector is non-standard and should be consistent Very good overall but the above would improve in my opinion.,1
Cool app for scheduling. Few hiccups sometime but still good.,1
"Amazing app. This really really helps me to increase my productivity, and to keep a note of the things which I need to do. And thank you so much for the cross platform support, I can access my tasks over my pc or anywhere I want. This app solved several problems of mine",1
"The app felt good enough for me to buy the yearly subscription, which I did and paid th 15€ it requested. But a week later they charged me 17 more euros to my credit card for the same subscription and the same features so I basically paid 32€ . THAT is a scam and unless I get my 17€ euros back I'm gonna keep the rating at one star. Edit: issue was solved and I got a refund for the extra money that was charged, all's well that ends well.",1
Very easy to use the interface is very good and rookie,1
Great app! No ads and does just what it says on the tin!!!,1
"I would have given it 5 stars but after latest update 3.0, it takes some time to load. Example, earlier when I wanted to change any block, it would be instant editing. But now I have to wait for sometime for it to load.",1
"lol i went to settings, change character value, and got myself 9M coins uwu btw is that cheating...? I mean well its right there",1
Best Todo list app I've ever used. Well worth the cost,1
Excellent so far. Better to include a feature to tick off tasks as a record that it was completed.,1
"Very nice looking app for tracking habits and tasks. Have already replaced my old task app for HabitNow. Glad you can purchase the premium version and not have to buy a subscription like many other apps are now doing. I've been unable to figure out how to make tasks repeat and modify the schedule of existing habits. If these capabilities don't exist, would love to see these as improvements.",1
"I've been a paper planner girl for years! I need the pretty colors and stickers. While I still have a paper planner (that hasn't been touched for months) I needed something on my phone because with 3 kids spaced 6 years apart, we are busy. We homeschool year round as well as appointments and family stuff. Artful Agenda fits everything I need. Update on the fly and it's PRETTY! I keep a tab open on my desktop as well as the app on my phone. ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐",1
Simple and to the point,1
"This is the best app I've found for getting everyday organised. Simple to use and intuitive. The one big drawback is that its storage sits on your local device. You can't register an account and use cloud storage, so if your local device fails you lose all your data and you can't sync with other devices. Apart from that, great.",1
Glad my dad found this. BEST EVER. this is just amazing. You can do so many things. I am premium and boy i tell you its the best thing ever. From customizing you task to ticking of the task. This is a must have for every type of person and every age. Recomended app.,1
"Good app, simple, easy, beautiful design, bright colors, auto backup to cloud, sync with calendar, it has two subscribe plans, free account and premium.",1
I liked it I just have to many things I want to put in it and I can't afford to pay for premium.,1
It helps me to plan my activity. Very recommended,1
Excellent,1
Great tool for coordinating between family members! I love being able to share lists so everyone is on the same page.,1
"Please keep tinkering, and improving. Thank you for this app",1
Pretty Good. Just the shop Items are really expensive and takes alot of time to actually get one.,1
Ok,1
"Make some more widgets, rest all app is nice and user-friendly",1
"Long time user of this app, problem is it doesn't have a search feature. Or if it does I can't find it. Sometimes I forget where I filed my note or task (again longtime user) and then it takes me a while to go through all my files to figure out which title heading I put it under, but if it had a search feature I could quickly find it and get back to being productive. For this reason I gave it 4 stars because it has room for improvement.",1
"I love the developer still active and it's apps getting better. But, i want to get icons but it's must be subscription. I want to one time purchase, but it's is expensive.. I want to buy part by part.. Like in theme i can buy separately the theme that i want. I want the same with the icon..",1
I love the prev. version having exactly timeline view of task instead of this congested box view. plz. keep it optional and revise/improve the repeated task within the day. And the remaining star is yours.,1
Functional,1
Easy to work out the app,1
"Great app! It really helps me to get things done. I have a few recommendations to make. It would be great if we could edit the stats of our hero. For example I want to lose/gain weight. I'd be nice if I can change the weight of my hero and have achievements for that. Also, it'd be nice to toggle the ""success level"" of each task. Let's say I have to do my homework. If it turns out that I did them with no mistakes I can get more XP and/or reward.",1
"Amazing, couldn't do without it! I use it for my personal to do lists/notes.",1
"Wish there were different ""skins"" for the app beyond fantasy, e.g. sci-fi, horror, real life, etc.",1
Good,1
Finally something that lets me feel like I'm using a paper planner but I don't accidentally leave it at home!,1
One of the cleanest UI's I might have ever used. I understand that the app is made for us to be able to stick to our schedules! But I think it's a shame they're not letting us double it's use as a time log too! I think the statistics can be made more informative like graphical representations and stuff. And we should also be given an option to just log in our schedules day after day without using the routines function because I have different schedules everyday!,1
Good,1
"The app keeps my annoying life very well organized even when I'm stressed because it can be used as any other kinds of lists such as a revenge list or a list which represents the ones that you've loved or hated as well....... I really owe a lot to this kind of app to get better when updating....... And I hope that we don't need to pay continuously, but buy once, free forever......😂😄",1
"I have been using this app for years now. I have tried other calendar apps on Android and IOS and this is by far my favorite apps. It may not have a bubbly interface like other calendars but the features are great, especially if you have multiple calendars to manage. The features that get added are helpful and useful as well. Thank you for a great app.",1
"This app is the best to schedule my day! Further more, here are some possible features to add! ; a homework option w/ reminder, water reminder, mood tracker, monthly routine, and calendar? Also would like if premium was cheaper :(",1
Works well but doesn't make a sound when it alerts me and I wish it would.,1
Easy to use,1
"Great so far, the Wunderlist import saved me a lot of time. I'm trying to get used to no having the list of lists show when opened. I think I'm gonna miss that. I do like that is not task/productivity focused. Most competitors put those features foremost. I like that here they're available but not prominent",1
"Love the app, it's much fun, engaging, and helpful to stay focused on your goals and developing new habits. Much better than competing apps (Habitica comes to mind) even if they have better social integration. Of course one can always add new features and improve design elements, but if you are looking for a task manager look no further. This is the best on the market. Highly engaging and fun to interact with.",1
"It seems good but there is no way for me to increase the ""art"" category. Music and drawing are not the only forms of art. Please change this. Maybe change art to ""crearivity"" but certainly add more creative pursuits so those who cannot draw or do music can increase it. Also aren't erudition and learning really the same thing? My conclusion is that this app is great but needs a lit of work.",1
Great Calender dose everything I need it to do. It is also easy to use and operate. I highly recommend using this Calender.,1
Amazing idea and super clean user interface. Everything links seamlessly to my other applications and helps get things organized for my day. I definitely recommend this app to keep track of how your busy day with appointments and meetings are going!,1
This is a superb way to motivate yourself to do things. To create new and healthy/fun habits and get rid of bad habits. Do you want to live a life full of adventures? Be creative and install this amazing app. I would suggest a clearer and friendlier GUI but overall itS AMAZING.,1
Works without problems and does what I need. Have used about a year now. Best calendar I have ever had.,1
I loved this app. Worked so great I purchased it. Now it has logged me out and says I don't exist.,1
Great app,1
"This app is good. I use it daily and it runs my life. I have too many tasks though, and anydo's plan my day feature is good at forcing me to postpone stuff to next week, repeatedly. Pls add a built in optional Eisenhower matrix tagging system - tag each item with a quadrant label. Add a matrix view option to view all today's tasks in quadrant view, with filters for specific list only or all items. It's hard work retyping any do items into other apps to view like this",1
Awesome app TBH.. seriously helped me a lot through my studies my daily routines to have time management in my life.. Kudos to Time tune app seriously very rarely you stumble upon a app Soo useful,1
Love the way it can be easily zoomed for both size and number of days.,1
Bug was fixed. This is for Samsung S10e and Note 10,1
Necessary. Needs a little more life and interaction to its graphics,1
This is a good thing to have,1
"Am excellent replacement for Toodledo. Still a little rough around the edges, but being actively improved.",1
Very useful app which perfectly suits my needs. I can set today's todos and track the habits. The functions are also very convenient.,1
Great app..but one suggestion..if you could add the feature of marking whether or not we followed a particular activity in the routine..that would be great.Like if I've planned to study..I can mark whether or not I actually studied.and then it could show the statistics of how much I stuck with my routine.please consider it.also you could add a goal tracker..Love your app.,1
"This app is fantastic! It helps to organize tasks and bring new positive habits into your life. And does it in a gamified, entertaining way. You should at least try it out!",1
Great productivity app to stay organized,1
This is the only thing that has proved successful in getting me to workout everyday! Simple but v v effective and its always a treat being able to tick off my habit as done at the end of the day :),1
"Even though I am having problems with notifucations, causing me to reset, this app is amazing as it is so easy to use and it aesthetic. I love this app because it is so easy to change your timetable according to the easily changing life we live.",1
Easy to use interface... Premium account links into other APPS,1
"Can be better, can be made more attractive and everything else is good",1
"I would like to Thank you Microsoft for creating this app, really useful app user friendly, looks clean, options are so cool, if they have add options of changing background to users wallpaper that would be really great 🥰 Awesome guys Thank you",1
"I find the app amazing. It is one of the best habit apps that I've used. The only thing I don't like is that I've bought the premium but I don't feel like it was worth it. The only thing that I really needed was to have more than 7 habits but, the rest is just decoration. It would be really nice, if there is an overall progress page to check how am I doing in every Habit, instead of going through every single one of them. Another thing that would do this app just perfect, would be the possibility of having a desktop app for the computer. Other than that, I recommend to download it. Keep doing it so!",1
One of d best apps that I came across.. it's easy to use and very effective.. helps a lot for someone like me who needs constant reminders 😄,1
"This app has become my life. I truly love it. It helps me work towards my goals in a very fun&supportive environment. My down points would be (mainly) because of gems. While the game is free, there are certain things you can only get through buying gems. Which is understandable, they need to be able to support themselves&the game. My problem is that while you can earn them for free, it's damn near impossible to compete with 200+ people in one challenge and get rewarded.",1
"I like this app. If it can sync easily and automatically without delay, I will give it 5 stars",1
Easy and practical 👍,1
Nice app for daily activities...,1
"This is a fabulous app! It helped me to stay focused when I had to work on my online homework. Now that I'm stuck at home because of quarantine, Forest helps me to concentrate on my work instead of all the distractions around me, like my phone. I love the sounds on the app like rain and birds chirping, and I like how it can let you play your own music too. It was very helpful for studying, and helped me to stay off my phone. 5/5!",1
"Love the way they keep updating new species of tree , keeps u motivated and kind of provides satisfaction at the end of the day ,",1
"So far, I love this app and the idea behind it. It holds me accountable for my tasks and habits which i really love. I would totally give it a shot.",1
"New to the app, but it looks very useful based on what I've seen thus far. I'm looking for an option we're saved routines can be implemented into the daily schedule, but are also tied to a kind of countdown timer that corresponds to the specific routine added (e.g., impromptu select ""laundry"" and it's automatically integrated/layered onto present schedule w/ a countdown clock allowing for whatever amount of time you preset for that routine). If it had/has that, then it's five stars for me.",1
Can UI can be improved to add habits with more customisation.,1
"Great helping app, would be 5 if events won't disappear occasionally, possibly because calendar is shared between two gmails",1
Overall Best Hebit tracker app - Need improvements in app ui [ For better touch experience ] [ Dark theme not up to mark ],1
"I just want to say that the tutorial was too much info, things like this should be explained in a short and concise way, at a good pace. It was just too long and too much to take in. I didn't even try the app though, I can't say what rating it deserves. I am unnistalling but I may come back to it in the future, it's not you, it's me. (Also, you can't delete your account on mobile but you can on desktop. I suggest people to try the desktop version since it may have more features)",1
"I love this app. I like how simple it is to use. Worth purchasing. The only thing I wish is that it would open to the weekly spot instead of to a single habit. Maybe there is way to make that happen, let me know! But if you are looking for simple but great habit tracker I highly recommend this one.",1
Have been enjoying using this. Helped in many ways. I would love to see auto planting the next forest after a configurable break. Those things would be a great add to the app,1
Great app for managing my ever growing to do list. There is the option to add tags to separate between work and personal projects. There is also a great feature that allows you to rapidly prioritise tasks by typing p1 p2 p3. Would recommend.,1
"Love it. As a Franklin planner user since '84, this is the closest app that I have found to that format. Only wish I would have is for a windows version that I could use on my office desktop that would sync across to my android phone and tablet.",1
It's a quite useful program. Works reliably.,1
"Best habit tracking apps. Clean, easy to use, options of goal tracking besides yes/no, and the ability to make notes. Wish that notes could be toggled by historicity. Can that be done please?",1
Excellent app,1
Could use more fonts and options and a habit tracker. But it's a great start.,1
"Great in its simplicity, minus side is disability to back up data.",1
Keeps pushing me to rate the app even though I already have (and gave you 5 stars) LOSES A STAR.,1
"Very good planning organizer, but there's still few bugs here and there. In the grocery list, why i can't open the completed lists? It's always close again after 1 second. Please fix.",1
"I tried out quite a few free scheduling apps that could be shared across members of a household/team, and this one was certainly best. One thing that I would like is if, when you make an event repeat, you could specify an end date for the repitition.",1
"I would like to have a widget on my homescreen, but I have to pay, however, it's really good for organize the tasks!!",1
"great so far, it would be nice to allow the 5 buttons on the widget have an option to skip a day, week or month forward or backward, if i would like to look ahead i have to open one or two apps when it could be a button you set on the widget. maybe even a button option that allows one widget to switch between multiple calendars, just thought id include that suggestion.",1
"I can access it using any device on which it is installed, I get reminders, it works for me !!",1
osm osm osm osm,1
The apps are functioning well and recommended trying for RPG theme if you love RPG 👍but there is a problem where sometimes when i added the task it does not appear at the task section and sometimes it becomes duplicate..,1
"Great app so far, still not sure about how everyting works...please can you create some warrior monk feature? (like shaolin rope, ecc.) Good job anyway!",1
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.,1
"Very Good Apps for All in one, routine, tasks, reminder, time schedule, Must have all Request owner to have Goal Tracking in it for Task created then Added Advantages",1
Love the app! 10/10. Most effective easily in this category.,1
"Widget not working correctly. when updating the date of task to future date, it still shows in today task",1
Good.,1
Easy to use and helpful to keep good habits on track.,1
Great useful app,1
I love pies. Why not make my daily schedule one! Easy to use and links to existing calendars.,1
"I love this app, its helped me quite a bit. I would love to provide 5 stars, but I'm having issues with no notifications even though I have them active and the widget is a bit fussy clearing randomly when I finish a task. I really hope these get fixed because then this will be the single most useful app I've ever used.",1
💜❤,1
"You can add one thing, when we'll touch on particular time period then the particular task should be displayed.",1
"Very very very good program, it provides to me all/most what i need to Manage My Aims & Planing for my dreams..📊📃 It also Enhance my productivity along the time bec. it has a full view about my own time [Days, Weeks, Months, Years] 📆 I'd like to purchase the program Premium Plan in the future if i started to use it almost.😊💳",1
"Tick Tick is just hitting it out of the park for me. I originally starting using it because I loved the built in pomo, along with habit tracking. A few months back I got interested in using a kanban board but they did not integrate well with a to do list. Now I see that tick tick has added the option of viewing lists in a kanban style. It is AMAZING. Now it's a truly powerful app that can be a one stop shop for every productivity tool I actually use. I love it!!!",1
can someone please tell me what to do to get alarm for everyday for daily routine and specific days automatically rather than creating the date everytime,1
Nice app,1
"I didn't realise how useful this would become, I've now got my teenager on it so zero excuses! It's pleasant to use, easy navigation and having it linked to Alexa is great. I'm using it for work, study and home life. If you can, get the premium version, it makes a helluva difference.",1
This app is very simple and easy 👍. My favorite quality that the app is offering it's users is the one time buy premium that's only 5 bucks!(finally not a monthly one so I can actually buy it) anyway love the app and I like my high importance tasks that I have to finish today... The importance level... Anyway see ya 🙃,1
Amazing app that helps me stay motivated and productive!,1
I tried many apps but this one is amazing. It is very easy to use and I will suggest that plz add copy paste option in it so that we can paste the same task easily.,1
Really helps me to keep things organized and is a great way to keep myself on track!,1
Good and user friendly,1
Easy to use,1
"It was great at first, it really helped me get my stuff done. But now, every 2 or so days, it stops sending me notifications so I go and refresh the background tasks, it works again for a couple days but then it happens again. Could you please tell me how to fix this? Other than that it's a great app 💖 Edit: I fixed the problem, the app is perfect now",1
I have been using this app for almost one year. this is must have app for avoid forgetting important things. One important feature I like is Widget. whenever I open my mobile it will always reminds me.,1
"I originally doubted how this would help me. But decided to try it & see exactly it was meant to do For me, he most useful thing is it fits my daily schedule into a 4×4 size widget. Using a small % of my screen. + the way it's organized, just a quick glance & I see what's happening for the whole day. Way more efficient than digging thru my calendar app. I use a month calendar widget, but don't want to make a 2nd large agenda widget. This solved the problem perfectly!",1
I like the app. I use the weekly planner widget thw most so it is easier to get organized. It syncs with Google calendar. The only reason I am not giving it a 5 stars is becauae after an update it stopped updating the week on my screen and I have to search for the right week everytime.,1
just installed Love that syncs with google. Wish the mobile app allowed Screen rotation. Wish I could Zoom on the week a month view. I understand mobile i in beta. Looking forward to the evolution.,1
It's Good.,1
Can you please update the app with custom categories ? It would make the app perfect. Edit:Fixed it.,1
"Best wunderlist replacement with one major flaw. As far as a to-do list app it is pretty decent and has what you would want. It is very tricky to figure out how to disable all of the random notifications this app sends you. That is my major complaint, but once you finally get it all disabled this app is decent. The layout is a little messy, but the smart grocery grouping is nice.",1
A very good app for people who can't focus and have background noise Pro tip - When set the timer plug in the earphones and onn the sound ❤ Loved it,1
Been using the app for a couple of weeks and have lost 4lbs already. Took a bit of setting up with the tasks and rewards but it is very customisable. Gamifying my life might be just the thing I need to get into better habits and lose some weight!,1
Functional. Handy. Lite. ❤️❤️❤️,1
"Almost Perfect, an option to export Archived Habits (preferably to excel) would be Great..",1
I like how easy is to create schedules for each day. Contains just the functions needed. Great app.,1
very smooth and elegant. works perfect as your daily planner,1
If you are struggling to become productive and cant get any work done then this is a good choice! Make sure you write down what all things you need to complete on a specific day set a timer for eg...1 hour or according to your convenience how much time it will take to complete that task and complete it and you wont be able to use your phone which will prevent you from procrastinating!,1
"So far so good. Wish I could see what was done on any given day. An option to show tasks with a completion indicator (strike through?) would be helpful. Also, would like to be able to mark a task completed for a previous day as I sometimes don't get to mark them on the same day.",1
Good one,1
"İ am a business owner in Azerbaijan, so my employees are not used to using alot of technology yet. I tried using other apps but they were to complicated for my team. But Any.do is really easy to use and less complicated. We use it as personal organiser but also as a company coworking platform. Really great app that i can recommend to small and medium size businesses, but u can also use it as a personal organiser. Also it is great that this app has many different language portals",1
So far this is the best app I have used to plan for my hw and studiesas it is very easy to set and plan the things you want .I highly recommend you to try this app.,1
Love Planner Pro to keep up with tasks and appointments. Optional alarms for meetings and events are very helpful to keep me on track.,1
Good,1
Have found app to be quite helpful. Aids in developing routine and good habit patterns. Beneficial for developing personal discipline.,1
I've really enjoyed the app and has been very helpful. although to me the app seems like it's not fully finished. I wish the stats you were building actually did something in game. the money also seems kind of pointless. I can buy items that I create but they just adjust your stats which I could easily accomplish through tasks,1
It comes as a widget on my phone so I can make it really big or put is small in the corner as a reminder. It's really useful!,1
"3. An option to arrange the tags alphabetically would be really helpful. An ""auto arrange"" would also work. Also, a password/pin lock with a Fingerprint locking facility. Thanks! 2. Love the new colors! Thanks for including them guys. 1. After a lot of contemplation, I decided to buy this app. On the whole, it's a great app. Tasks, calenders, tags, folders. Pretty much, all that one could ask for. I've used GTasks since ages. Just needed more options in an app and this fits the bill perfectly.",1
It just might be one of the best apps ever made. It has helped so much with my productivity and has such wonderful features. I love it!,1
Functional and serves all needs for to do lists. Will happily give 5* when integration for Alexa custom lists is implemented.,1
"Love the app, it's much fun, engaging, and helpful to stay focused on your goals and developing new habits. Much better than competing apps (Habitica comes to mind) even if they have better social integration. Of course one can always add new features and improve design elements, but if you are looking for a task manager look no further. This is the best on the market. Highly engaging and fun to interact with.",1
"It took me a while to understand how to use certain features, but once I did I found it to be EXACTLY what I needed! If Google would allow reminders to come through, it would be the PERFECT time management tool! My only thought would be if there was some sort of tutorial or guide to help know what some things were for (like when I'm changing the color scheme, I can't always tell what's what) For those not wanting their calendar clogged up, just make those things hidden after you've added them.",1
"Very helpful, there's ofcourse an alarm clock or a timer to do the job but this is kinda satisfying. Also the statistical analysis helps me understand the time I actually spent getting stuff done rather than just staring at it.",1
I LOVE THIS APP!,1
Good,1
I'm thoroughly enjoying this app so far. I've been a lot more productive and on point with my tasks as well as keeping up with my personal studies and hobbies. The game aspect has been great for me to hold accountability of my actions while finding joy in completing self-made goals and gaining experience and items.,1
"Changed my life. The group feature, when you have a family, is a must have. Seeing our avatars morph and change while we level up our life, priceless. This app is worth it, it's one of the best decisions I've made for me and my children. They're excited to do chores, and I no longer procrastinate. I just can't recommend this app enough.",1
Easy to use and surprisingly motivating. I definitely recommend this for anyone looking to form and stick to healthy habits.,1
Only issue I have encountered so far is that it doesn't seem to work for meetings that occur every two weeks. Works on the first reminder but then doesn't update to the next occurrence.,1
Nice app for study thanks,1
"Best app for accountability and Routine management, I just love it.. Also the widget is awesome.",1
Wonderful feature flexibility between several calendars. I am recommending my entire office use it. I have the paid version and the one time $4 is absolutely worth it.,1
"The app is allready great. The amount of customisation is surreal and with a bit of tweaking you can really make it work. The sentimental value you create this way really helped me grow. As the app is rpg themed, those elements could be further enhanced imo. I think a customisable character would be fun. More options to spend the currency other then personalised awards is what im getting at. This way you really build something with the effort you've put in. For the games.. Keep up the good work",1
Greattt app!!,1
bagus,1
"I like this app as it helps to track things that are important for me. I'm still exploring how effective the method is but I like what I found so far! It'd be nice to have a way to see the correlations or tendencies among habits if any. Good job, nice idea!",1
Really great app. It would be great to see how much money I saved by not smoking. Just an improvement an app developers should think about :) Great job!,1
"I have used Habitica for a year now, and I would suggest this app to anyone who wants to meet people with the same goal of building healthy habits. I have met amazing people, battled in hard quests which driven me to finish my dailies, and joined a variety of challenges! The app still has some glitches here and there, but I mostly use the website.",1
Nice,1
"The app is simple & clean. Tracks Habits efficiently. The only reason I am giving 4 star is because Reminder notifications aren't working properly. Habit Tracker, please fix it!",1
Very interesting application just to complicated for me,1
"Habitica is the best productivity app I've used thus far. It lasted me for months. The quests are the most motivating feature, and I was able to take down a couple bosses solo. However, motivation dried up weeks into my first fetch quest because despite being extremely productive, I had no chance of finding even one shard. Unless you're comfortable teaming up with a bunch of strangers to take on quests, there becomes a point when being solo makes the quest motivation feature impossible.",1
"Excellent app!! I use it every day. I've got a few small requests though, if possible! Another app I tried had the option to drag & drop timelines to reschedule times, e.g. make things a little shorter or longer. It's not an absolute necessity, but I find it a little clunky having to edit each event in turn, although I do love the ""add this gap to previous/next activity"" option. Also, not a necessity but would be a nice touch - I'd love to be able to reorder my routines. Couldn't figure out why they were all in a funny order, but it arranges them alphabetically, and since I make a routine for each day of the week, they were all very jumbled up. I've solved it for now by adding numbers to the start of each name, but again, just slightly clunky. As for the rest, I absolutely adore it. Love the persistent notification; each time I pick my phone up absentmindedly to check my notifications, I see what I'm meant to be doing, and it gets me back on track. Thank you!!",1
"Been using for a little over a week and I really enjoy this experience. Traditional to-do list functionality combined with a habit tracker and pomodoro timer really hits all the marks I need from a productivity app. My only complaints are the lack of certain functionality for the Mac app, but on Android you're knocking it out of the park.",1
"This is the best productivity app I've ever used! Easy to use and efficient! So happy to complete all the tasks in a systematic way and also by not forgetting them! I haven't upgraded to premium yet and still the app is at its best! I surely recommend everyone to try out this app and thank you ""Tick Tick"" for making so many things simpler! 😄✌🏻",1
Its really smart idea to see at a glance from your homescreen all your planned activities,1
"Love it so far! Excited for the ""coming soon"" items. I use a paper planner bc digital planners never seem to have the layout I want but so far this seems to be a great replacement!",1
"I have tried multiple kinds of planner apps and this is the best of them all. It is the only one I found that lets me make recurring to-dos, have everything in a calendar view and give each task a duration (paid features), track habits, have focus sessions, subtasks, reminders, get summaries about productivity, and sync with all my devices (MacBook, iPad, and android phone). The free version is good but I highly recommend the paid version. I am more motivated and productive because of this app.",1
Fantastic app which helps to keep me organised. I have used it for over three years now. Keep up the good work.,1
"Very effective, however for the past few weeks (maybe months), the countdown timer continues despite opening apps out of my whitelist.",1
I miss the old lay out of lines instead of squares on the daily calendar... Now it feels like Google calendar wish they gave the option of choosing the display layout.,1
Gut😊,1
GOOD HELP,1
Good. Use is simple and very intuitive.,1
"I like this app but I dont understand why I cant set up tasks that repeat unless they're habits. Or edit the categories. A habit is something you want to always do, I want to plan reoccurring tasks that are temporary.",1
Does its job,1
"Its awesome how you can categorise different to do list separately side by side. When you click done, it will show the date task is done. I like to use it to see how long a product can last.",1
Excellent for daily tasks and scheduling future ones,1
"I have been using this app for a week now. It is wonderful. However few suggestions, manager i should be able to see how many assigned task is given to the college",1
"Very recommended! I'm a student and use TickTick all the time. Even without the premium features (which are very cheap and make the experience much better), this app WILL help you manage your tasks and your time. It's very intuitive and easy to use and you can sync it with your computer, which makes you even more productive. I've been actively using TickTick for quite some time now with the premium membership... Can't say a single negative thing about it",1
"My favourite productivity and habit tracker app, even though I don't use too many features it can provide. It's attractive, and it feels like more fun, but I like to keep it simple. Together with my (paper) Productivity Planner I am unstoppable!",1
Great app no regrets for downloading it 👌 I highly recommend this reminder app.,1
Great for groceries and remembering long-term to-dos,1
Awsome app,1
I always preferred writing my task on a book. But a book and pen is not handy always an you tend to forget. This is perfect to Task it down before you forget,1
Fantastic app which helps to keep me organised. I have used it for over three years now. Keep up the good work.,1
"Beautiful and customizable app. Synchronization with calendars works flawlessly. Love the design. The widget is awesome, I keep it on my home screen. No ads whatsoever, in my experience. I may buy the premium just to support the devs, even though the free version has everything you need.",1
"Out of all the RPG themed productivity apps out there, this one has certainly met my needs. To whoever who comes up with the idea and design of this app, you certainly created a miracle for a guy like me! Thank you so much for creating this app, dear developers! P.S. I'll be giving this app a proper review one day, after a few weeks / months of using this! :) Till again, you've certainly created a great future for me, through this app man! 😭",1
"Everything is able to be modified. You can gamify whatever you want of your day a day life. It would be nice to sort tasks as you wish, just moving them in the order you want without needing to rename them or other tricks to put them in the order you like. However still being quite good for everything it offers",1
Very creative. and a good idea too!,1
"Wowza, this app is definitely an upgrade!! Great customization and cloud backup. But, I need to see the due date in widget. Edit, dear Steve, if I wanted full screen widgets, I'd just open the app🙄 needs option to show dates on medium size.",1
"I'm loving this app. I would have given 5 stars, but the only thing I didn't like is that it doesn't have any reminder. You have to buy it. Anyway, overall the app is impressive. You can go for it.",1
Great app,1
I use this as a list maker. Using free version. I really like how it let's me organize and that I can sync it with my computer and Alexa.,1
Very easy to use. Have all I need,1
"I have been using this app, this is just one gorgeous 'stay focused ' app, but at times when I want the app to open it shows stopped and I have to reinstall.",1
I have been using Artful Agenda on a desktop this year and love all it's features. Now the app makes it even more accessible. I love planning meals and mapping out my day!,1
it's a very good app I like how the to do list is categorized.,1
It was really helpful to keep track of what I have to do everyday. I think that it is easy to use and it could be even better one day,1
"This app is very good for keeping on task, and everything is totally customizable. One thing I would improve is the simplisity of it. Right now, it's a bit too much to handle, and if there was an easier way to do things, it would make this app even greater!",1
easy to use.,1
Great app! I use this all the time. Very customizable,1
Best habbit app,1
"Turning your life into a RPG is a great way to stay motivated. If they can provide something like a monthly habit tracker, it would be great",1
"Where do I start. I'm a paper planner addict, but I work in the Healthcare Field and can't bring all pens, stickers, and other paraphernalia. I cannot believe I can work on my schedule from my laptop and it immediately transfers to my phone. I'm floored. What a great thing, not to mention it's only going to get better as time goes! It gives me a bit of peace and calm to work on my planner during the day, thank you Kate!",1
"After testing the app for a while, I was ready to purchase it but read on your user guide that searching for tasks is not available on Android. Do you know when it would be available? Also, is there a one time fee purchase option? Is there a GMAIL integration feature? Like Google Tasks? I like the minimalist simplistic clean look of your app 👍. Nice work on the Widgets 👍. Thanks 🙂",1
"This seems to tick (ha!) most of the boxes, multiple to do lists, habit tracking, Pomodoro timer. The only place I wish it were better is in statistics and graphs of habit and to do completion",1
"Realmente ayuda mucho, me sirvió bastante pero.. Parece haber un problema con las notificaciones sonoras, solo me avisa visualmente. Por eso lo califico como 4 estrellas",1
I love this app. It has helped me with healthy habits 💛🧡,1
"Really great, like the pomo. If the completed tasks can be rearraged in a different order instead of being defaulted as follow an alphabetical order that'll be perfect",1
I was using this app for years and I'm used to it but those ads are so annoying. It's sad for me to look for other options. You should leave those ads out,1
It works well for building and tracking habits. No obtrusive ads or anything negative so far. Thank you developers!,1
Love love love this app... but you guys can add some more features to make it a bit more easier to use..,1
"Отличное приложение. По моему мнению, намного удобней, чем в других.",1
"I live this calendar app, but I wish it was a widget.",1
The essence and notion of this application is not just to define activities from day to day basis but to remind us that its really not about perfection... Its about progress... This application teaches us not just to address holistically in our commitment and time management but also push drastically at the same time our attitude towards commitments.. Senior Project Engineer here... It really helps alot... Thank you.,1
Sometimes widgets don't update themselves and stay the same day.,1
"First of all, I have to say that I almost downloaded and tried most of the habit tracking applications on Google Play and finally decided to use this one, I was looking for the below features: 1- Ability to have habits as yes or now, or a number of repetitions 2- No restriction on the number of per repetitions day 3- Show statistics related to repetitions per day as well as over all numbers 4- Be able to backdate a habit to a date in the past And I found all those features in this app I was hoping for a dark mode and cloud back in the free version but it's fair enough to have dark made exclusively for premium. Honestly, I think if you add cloud backup to premium, I will be purchasing that.",1
"Update - Merging two tasks vanished both of them. Tried again, same result. Great App. Recommend/ Request : In Location reminders, couldn't find a way to switch the map 🗺 to Satellite 🛰 view. If it's absent, kindly add it as it is very essential to mark most locations. If I missed it, kindly 👉 me.",1
"I'd be lost without this app. Love it, keeps me organized",1
It is a perfect app for organizing the routine. It is easy to understand the settings and has many customization options.,1
"Hi I really enjoy and appreciate this app. As a mobile app it works perfectly for me, however I'd really appreciate a computer version that can sync with it. I'm not sure if this exists already? I like that the app is on my phone so that i can constantly check my schedule anywhere - any time, however when I feel the need to adapt and change my schedule, it feels a little cluttered and time consuming. I frequently feel the urge to open it up on my computer as it is easier to work with this interface given the larger screen and increased capability. Please consider this in future upgrades, Regards,",1
It's a great app especially for entrepreneurs who have too many scheduled meetings in a day or for students who get a lot of homework or have to do a lot of studies in a day,1
"Very effective. I would give 5 stars ,but writting space too little. Larger writting space will help much better.",1
Probably the best task managing app out there.,1
Hope we can change the fonts' COLOR while we pick a picture theme.,1
"First of all it's an excellent app. I like the fact that it is highly customizable. However, I'd like to make a suggestion. Your app lacks the ""emotional"" aspect a bit. I suggest to add support of small custom avatar-like images to the tasks instead of monotone colored icons. This way a task will associate with something positive/inspirational. Pressing on a task could then show a larger version of the image in the task view screen. Do not understimate the power of visual associations.",1
Excellent app for time management,1
This is my favourite personal todo apps after going through so many to-do apps. I like the calendar view that link with Google calendar. All events can be added direct in the apps. I use this apps calendar view a lot. They improve a lot from time to time especially recently with the natural language which make me even more productive. Like the web app as well. The support they give when facing issue also very professional. It sure a 5 stars apps that suit my needs.,1
i am loving this and plan to buy it. do you intend to add a widget for phones and tablets?,1
"Does a good job, i like the widget",1
"At fırst it seems complicated, bu after some days you will find it handy and usefull",1
"This app is very good. Thanks for building the app. It makes my time table easier. Now i can study with enough time. and I also do other works by this. there would be 5stars for this app, but i'll give it 4 stars. Because, there is just one music track free. other one costs 500coins. you should unlock at least 2 music tracks. Overall, I recommend y'all who wants to improve in study and decrease laziness.😄",1
Best app to organise my daily tasks and making a exact routine that i want. It really helpul for students..,1
I love this app and use it on my Android phone. Now I have an iPad and cannot find this app for it. Is there an iOS version available?,1
"Very good app. The only note is that it takes a while to make it syncronizing properly. But after you get it, works like a charm.",1
Sehr hilfreich.,1
This app has changed my life. I have ADHD and this app allows me to have control over the the things I want to do in my life. Some small critiques would be to add sub lists within other lists i.e. a groceries list with seperate store lists with in. And the ability to move a task from one list to another would be helpful.,1
Love it!,1
Now I can relax,1
Very pleased with the interface and overall functional capabilities of the app.,1
Would be great to customize the alarm. I want to test pavlov effect with supplements.,1
Its really a good app. Worth using. Everything is fine but I found a problem : it notifies tasks with a notification sound not a music tone. So one not even know if it has notified if the person is a bit far away from the phone. That's it.,1
Great help every day,1
Great app! How can I change the alarm sound,1
Great app!,1
"This app is very good since I love nature and doing things involving nature, at school, =￣ω￣= I Raye this 5/5 since its a great app that helps me with tine management ︶w︶ *Thumbs up* This app also gives calming audios that makes me focus on my work better... I also found this app from NataliesOutlet! She is the best too! UwU Thx for this amazing and super wonderful app! ☜☆☞◌⑅●♡⋆♡LOVE♡⋆♡●⑅◌",1
"This app is practical, beautiful, fun, and easy to use! Highly recommend!",1
"Good app! I just wish their was a way to add a morning routine with subtasks or sub habits. Also I wish you could order your habits/tasks however you want, drag and drop style.",1
"This is so far the best productivity app I've used. It has everything I need - to-do list, kanban, calendar, pomodoro, habit tracker. I used to use a few apps to have all these features, but now I just use this app. Would be nice though if I can tag and group habits, too. Also, is the habits feature accessible in the desktop version? I haven't figured it out.",1
"The app is what you make of it. A big imagination will take you far. I wish it had better mobile support though. Many functions require a computer. And it'd be nice to be able to preview all the cosmetic options that cost gems (the cash currency). Without a preview, its almost gambling, especially with hairstyles",1
Nice,1
It helped me,1
This app has helped me to organize my daily task.,1
This app is great but maybe let us tick task we completed from widget as it's annoying the app will opened up when I pressed the box to tick what I've completed everytime,1
Amazing app. I use it everyday and I feel that my life is more organized.,1
It's well put together. I think it works very well for that it's for and can help provide structure to your day. The next step for the app is to incorporate goals and goal metrics. Help me track if I'm getting 8 hours of sleep a night or studying 12 hours a week.,1
Pretty good calender app. Would like the ability to set multiple alarms for single events though.,1
Nice app. I'll give 5 stars for this app. It really helps me to be a productive person everyday!,1
...And more!,1
Great app,1
How do you decrease the timing of the alarm??My only question😃,1
So close to being the perfect app. 2 things needed before I switch to using it. #1. Add ability to edit and change habit status for previous days. sometimes i don't have time or forget to update my habits on the day of. #2. Ability to set first day of week for calendar (i prefer Monday),1
Been using it for years. Awesome,1
Great,1
Very easy to use and really clear. The only thing I miss in this app is seeing the completed tasks. Besides that it's been a great app that helped my productivity.,1
"This is a perfect app solution for as a hybrid between digital and paper calendars. I love the ""extras"" to make is like my paper calendar in visual effects. I also enjoy the ability to combine multiple digital calendars into one! This is perfect!",1
"Great way to keep track of everything I have to do. I can create different groups of tasks and then select items from each of them to add to today's list and the ones I don't complete are easily seen tomorrow when creating that daily list. I just wish I could prioritize with numbers (1, 2, 3 ...) and not just stars.",1
Hi Steve. Is it possible to add voice reminder notifications in your app using google TTS tool?,1
"I love this app! I have the pro version and the layout is very clean and organized. However, only 4 stars because it does not work on multiple devices.",1
The perfect planner..Only thing missing is that Remimder is not working..,1
This is one of the best I have ever had.,1
"Ayush, This app has helped me greatly in planning my to do list as a student. The energetic reminders are the beat part that force you to take up a work as soon as it rings. I highly recommed this app to people of all age who wish to manage their time or to those who have a great problem in following their schedule. Thankyou Time Tune Team",1
"Very nice app that helps you organize your tasks and time. Links with Google calendar for the best experience. Has a pro version with a monthly payment, but is still very useful without.",1
Very effective!,1
"No problems with it! Love the calendar integration, voice input, sync with desktop. 2020 update: This is my favorite app and it keeps getting better. The widgets are really useful, as are the custom filtered lists. I have ADHD, and usually forget a lot, but I put literally everything I want to remember in this app: tasks, appointments, movie recommendations. It's easy to sort and tag all everything I put in the app, and I love that it works with my laptop and web browser as well!",1
The AP has helped me keep abreast of all tasks and supported 100 % completion,1
Nice app. the icon got problem.,1
Great app. Pulls together lots of info that keeps me in-the-know and sane.,1
Extremely user-friendly app that keeps me organized.,1
"Perfect for people who want to get organized and desire an app more robust than a checklist. It has profound customization ability. The reward system is more complex than competitors. For someone with significant attention issues, this has really helped me to feel invested. Subtasks and autofails are great features. Would be 5 stars if developers: 1. Allowed subtasks to renew as collapsible tasks not just tied in 2. Made tutorial/videos. Full functionality will be a learning curve for many",1
"Been using this app for a while as an University student and I am more organized than ever, however there is an issue that bothers me. When reminding a task on Desktop To Do or Online version it does not update on the mobile version and does not remind unless I manually open the mobile version so it updates the reminder. Other than that, I have just what I need.",1
Best for schedule,1
"Cute and functional little organisation app. Used the free version for a couple of months, liked it, transitioned to Premium - it's a one-off payment for a lifetime subscription, thought it was worth it. Clean design, good system. Here's what I think would make the app even better: 1. Setting a duration for tasks, not just habits. 2. Being able to move untimed tasks up and down the list. 3. More task icons! These are just things I would like ideally - love the app regardless!",1
Easy to use & very helpful!,1
"My productivity has increased ×10 times just because of this app. Now not only can I stay focused and not get distracted by my phone but also keep a track of my time spent and my daily,weekly,monthly or yearly productivity. One suggestion though, please try new features like scheduling and other such features. I love this app!❤😍",1
Good balance of task options and simplicity has made this my go-to to-do app at the moment. You can see Microsoft's Outlook experience shining through with the options that are available on the tasks but you can also see that they've thought about the user experience rather than just making Outlook tasks look better. The list groups and My Day allow enough organisation without over-complicating it. Nice job Microsoft.,1
Love how functional and pretty this planner is! I paper plan but this is perfect for on-the-go.,1
"The app is good and in general highly customizable, but it has one flaw: it uses days (24 hours periods) as a basic unit of measure, but it doesn't let you change the default starting hour (midnight). This is inconvenient for people who have unusual working hours and it makes the app impractical to track daily tasks for users who are more productive at night. I would rate it as a 5 stars app, if I could choose when my day ends and be able to log my dailies properly.",1
"A great app to keep you up and moving, especially being in quarantine :) (this review was made at the time of covid 19)",1
Really love the app. It's exactly what I was looking for.The only thing it's missing is a desktop version or website . That would be really helpful,1
Handy app keeps me organised and on track with jobs,1
Good visual representation,1
I really love this app It's fantastic in many ways. I wish I could adjust the overdue settings as tasks are set as overdue too quickly for me :),1
Limits lists to 200 items. That was old. It's better now,1
Fantastic app to get it together. Still lacking a few features: eg creating lists,1
Very easy to make new routines and activities if you want to organize your time a little better,1
Excellent planner,1
"This is the app which I use for almost a year. There is one issue I have faced recently. Namely, some tasks and events do not synchronize on multiple devices where I installed the app. I'm using this app on my Android smartphone, as well as on iPad. I would be very pleased if you fix it.",1
"A good app, gives me the chance to save my completed tasks amongst my documents on windows for easy recall at a later date when I've got to repeat a task some time later. The negatives are: 1. on each task, any text entered on 'next step', doesn't show on the task in Microsoft Outlook. 2. There is no way of categorising your tasks, other than creating folders and switching between folders. 3. Woking with attachments on tasks using my Live mailbox is diffacult, attachments can't always be opened",1
"Wonderful application, thank you.",1
"Dear Developers, When syncing will be fixed? Thanks",1
Sort by due date works perfect with subtasks.,1
An excellent app for focusing on whatever you are doing..I would recommend this app for people who are easily distracted like me.,1
"Simply the BEST Business Calendar, I have use for ordinary and very Busy People",1
"I'm trying to use this a family organiser and so far so good. The only feature I'd really like is to share reminders - is that possible? E.g. if I set a task in a shared list, I'd like everyone to receive a reminder for that task (or at least the person who has been assigned). As it stands, you can only set up reminders for yourself.",1
"This app is fantastic! I work from home anyway, and with the disruption due to the Coronavirus, it was difficult to maintain my usual schedule. By the end of the day, I hadn't accomplished much and really didn't know where the time had gone. I downloaded Sectograph and it has made all the difference. I am getting my work done and even have free time to enjoy. I even recommended it on Twitter yesterday.",1
Great app to keep you focused on the tasks at hand. The minimum time that I could set to grow the tree is only 10 minutes. Wish the minimum was for 5 minutes. Great app and the pro version is only $5. That money is really worth the spend.,1
great!,1
Fantastic and flexible app!,1
"Displaying the ""Contacts"" calendar of every Google account cannot be deactivated in Calendar & Tasks list (it re-activates immediately).",1
"Trying to instill better habits in my life. This app has been such a big help, very methodogic and gives me daily reminders to log before I go to bed.",1
"Just installed this yesterday. Loved it. Love the concept. Love the design. Too bad the free version can't have access to the calendar 😝 but otherwise, it's a great app. Am gonna give it a go for another few more weeks before deciding to commit to premium.",1
"New user and I'm impressed! A lot of neat features I've been looking for in apps like this. it's obvious dev is active and listening and thats a great sign. If I have an immediate suggestion, it'd be for us to be able to add tab categories of traits besides the default characteristics/skills; for example to add things like ""personality"", ""lifestyle"" or however we want to organize our skillset categories, so those 2 sections aren't cluttered. A search option for icons too maybe? Keep it up!",1
"We tested four other project management platforms against Todoist for our digital marketing team and nothing can match the simplicity of Todoist. It may look on the surface like it is lacking features, bells, whistles, and polish, but it's simplicity is magical. I am in love with this app. After years of using this for free, I am more than happy to pay your company for the team services. Looking forward to a long relationship of productivity.",1
"I would definitely like the Premium version, I really want those labels and filters!👍🏻 Not to mention ready-made templates - awesome! 😍 And you can make your Todoist as simple or as complicated as you want, with loads of apps to integrate with it. I really think this is one of the very best organiser apps! 💗 Only quibble here is I think it wouldn't have been too much to expect for at least a few reminders to be available in the free version! But thanks for a really great app! 💗",1
Best app for remainders. It would better to have date for task list under upcoming category in the widget,1
There's no search option for mobile version even I already have the latest version,1
"I love being able to have categories and sub headings within the lists, so work, personal etc",1
"Life-changing, if you use the app right it can very much help you like no other app I've found so far! I have to say a big thank you to the developers, you have no idea how much you've helped me and my family in a time of crisis by just something as simple as this although I do wish there was an option in the app so that the notifications worked like alarms because I have to use a separate app to do that because notifications are so timid. Actually truly life-changing thank you",1
Good.,1
Simple and easy to use. Love it,1
"such a great app, so organized and clean. my favorite part that you can make your own tags! its make it way more satisfying. you should get the app for free!!!!!",1
Great,1
"Wonderful app! It keeps me motivated, knowing that after checking off a task, I'm closer to earning a reward.",1
Its fine,1
This app is great so far. But I wish there was an option to select several days at a time for each routine.. if there is already pls let me know.,1
Aweosome,1
Thank you for such a great app! Was wondering though if it were possible to sync also calendar reminders from Google calendar and not just events,1
"I only really use this as a to-do list after wunderlist stopped. This app is good. You can easily share and print lists. There is a lot more to it, but for my needs it is perfect. Only downside is that you need a MS account to use it, this is so it can sync to your pc.some people might not like this, bit it doesn't bother me. Edit: now that you can group lists together, this app is great.",1
Reliable and adaptable,1
"The BEST app for motivation and tracking! Even putting the game aspect aside, I have never seen a more user-friendly app for habit/task tracking. I love how there are different categories for habits, tasks, and daily to-dos. It's customizable. Getting coins is motivation! Ive recommended it to everyone! Only thing I wish it had: a way to see your stats based on your missed to dos or frequency of habits. For instance: most health lost due to *blank* etc.",1
Love this app! All time based/entire day events in visually streamlined view.,1
Does this app have auto sync with Google account?,1
very good app,1
Very helpful and users friendly app.,1
I use this app daily! I love it! Great job wouldn't change anything,1
"Pros: I like the design overall. Reminders work well. I think the black theme is great for reducing eye strain. Cons: The search feature is lacking - if I search a single word, it may return tasks with that word in the details before tasks with that word in the title (which I would expect to see first). Task in multiple tags don't always display as expected. Can't 'select all' or 'select all by tag' to batch postpone/schedule. Can't see total # of tasks in a day selected in calendar view.",1
but it keeps crashing in the middle of a sessio . also i keep having problems when logging in. so i only fix it by uninstalling and reinstalling it 😞 please fix this bug.- previous review i did send my problem to your app platform and apparently i just have to disable auto update from both playstore and the appstore of oppo. thank you!,1
Happy to see my progress. It's a great app to keep a track for my daily routines and things which I paid limited attention to create that into my regular day to day life.,1
Very good planning app,1
"The app is highly recommended and one of the popular ones. But after trying many other apps, it can use more features than just ""plant trees"" as reward and blocking mode. Plus most items in the shop cost a lot of coins, which means you have limited resources to decorate your forest with a free account. So the app will get boring to most of the free users after some time. The app is good, but it should upgrade to more exciting features (like daily plans, cheap shop items, etc) for free users.",1
"Mostly great, I just wish I could make my main to do list my home page.",1
It's great to be more productive. It has helped me to study more efficiently.,1
"Good but still needs improvements. At least, it should be able to give high priority to task at the moment of creating them.",1
Good experience in the past but too much advertisement recently!! It makes the experience quite bad ...,1
Good,1
Awesome app.,1
Big help as I always have mobile phone with me,1
I use this to help me see what my day looks like. The circular shape helps me related to easier. I know and I have open spots and I know and I am busy. It sinks with Google so I don't have to import information multiple times. Really like it.,1
좋아요,1
"I like this app, I am just unsure whether I can sync one profile on two devices. I dont want to purchase the pro version for both my devices and have to set up my different routines for each app.",1
Simple and nice. Can add up little more,1
