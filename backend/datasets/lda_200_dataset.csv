"OK, I love the app, it's great, but the notifications just doesn't work, they are broken, and it's the main feature I'm looking for, fix it in order to give you the five starts"
Way over priced for what it does. Not worth it!
"So it's good. I payed for pro but the issue I'm having is adding my routine to my timeline because whenever I try and add it, it takes me to edit my routine. It's really annoying because I'd like my routine in one clean place. If this is fixed I'd definitely rate it 4 stars"
Some daily tasks just disappear a minute after I tick them. This bug is affecting me for about a week now and I'm already tired of it.
Excellent replacement for Wunderlist! A nice feature would be to automatically delete completed tasks from certain lists...or an option to print only the active list. On my iPad I nearly hit print with 400 pages of completed tasks! Other than that it's perfect.
"The ability to prioritize and assign dates has been awesome in two major ways. First, the underlying stress of not knowing if I'm missing something is way down. I've kept other to-do lists, but they get so bloated and it's easy to lose track of what is really important, and then the very process of going through to check became a job in itself. The second way this app has changed my life is professionally. I answer emails quickly and finish easy things I need to do for teammates first."
Themes and location based reminders are under subscription. Both are free on most of apps like this. Thanks but no. I'll pass and keep using Google keep
I love the concept & look of this mobile app & the desktop version. I wish I could set recurring tasks or add time reminders to tasks. You also can't set reminders if you add an event directly into Artful Agenda. You have to add it to your Google calendar first to set the reminder then let it sync to Artful Agenda. I've paid for the year subscription & I'm really hoping it has more functionality by the end of my subscription or I won't be renewing.
This app is easy to use but my biggest issue is that when i add notes or check off tasks when off line they dont save
"Great app, most of the features with reasonable limitations are available in the free plan already. Pomo sometimes doesn't work though, the timer just gets stuck at 25:00 after it starts"
It was okay but when I tried to set a reminder for 15 minutes from now it said reminders set in the past will not show. That is extremely inconvenient and annoying . I tried setting it for 15 minutes from now but didn't work. Would have given five stars if it wasn't for this issue
"I don't know why but this app doesn't function well on my phone. I have enabled all the settings but whenever I try to open this app it says ""forest"" keeps stopping. I love this app, but I want a way out of this problem."
The tutorial looks simple and a good layout but when I make an entry 9 out of 10 times it disappears and I need to re-enter it. Half the time dosent work
Good one
this app sucks
"Calendar has a lot of good features but half the time my reminders don't go off so I miss them. Paid for the full version but it still didn't help. All of my Friday reminders finally chimed on Sunday, kinda pointless!!"
Bom
I'd rather have continous ads than a payed time subscription. Honestly the subscription seems pretty shady for somethng you can easily do yourself... $3.69 for a month subscription and $36 bucks for a yearly subscription? Seriously? Why not just pay a premium one-time payment costing $10? Pathetic.
Right now i started this but feel very happy to install this application is its do easy and fast working.
shows monthly when startup even after changing it in the settings to show weekly. otherwise all around good app.
The app really nice.....i request that the voice notification should be made more clearer and voice should be like dominating that can make orders
"Would have given it 5 stars, but it doesn't seem to want to rotate when using my tablet."
The free app works well but pops up with annoying notifications every now and then to remind you to set more reminders... Kind of pointless. I'm also not a fan of the subscription model for premium. The layout and app itself is good though so it's a shame about those negatives. I would have considered buying if there was a one-time payment model.
"Ive used this app a couple times now, only uninstalling because school ended, but this app is amazing when it comes down to it. It encourages people to do the stuff that they need to without the complication of being told off by others. Plus, it has a cool rpg theme thats great for anybody who has grown up with/rpg game like elements."
"Great idea, but does not give notifications for me, which was really the thing I was looking for...."
"I think it's a great app, and a lot of fun. I had some trouble figuring things out at first, but everything works. The only complaint I would have is the cost... It would be nice to have some of the features, but they are too expensive."
Everything is good but i would like to see more then a five slots for habits
This app stops working everytime I install it. I have already taken its subscription but now everytime I open it crashes. I have reinstalled the app several times but the problem isn't solved.
"Dude. Don't we all want people to pay us for everything we come up with. XXXXXXX Hi! Thanks for the attentive reply. Though this app was not worth the payment or storage space for me, I did find one that works nicely. Looking forward to more replies, hopefully relevant, or none at all."
"Really like this app, the layout, and ease of use. However, I did not see a way to go back and edit your scheduled days. Everything else you can edit,..time, date, category, but wanted to change my days and I had to delete the entry and start over to modify my scheduled days. Otherwise, I would've rated it 5☆s"
"This app really draws my attention. Forest not only sends out meaningful messages (protect the green environment and save the future), but it is also a friendly reminder for me of staying focused on study and work, instead of being distracted."
"This app is brilliant! Clean, simple, and ultimately customizable. I've been wanting something like this for a while!"
"I love the app but recently the widgets have been glitching, they go blank or sometimes do respond when I click a checkbox."
Laggy.
Think its great but keeps going black and crashing all the time!
"This has everything I'm looking for from a UI perspective except one key thing: the ability to invite someone else to add/complete list items with you. It's the function Wunderlist fulfilled for us and I've been looking for a replacement ever since they were bought by MS. Add it, and it will be the dream list app I want!"
Notification is not of up to my expectation. Need to keep on reminding us until we check or tick it... Besides that.. The way of organizing the tasks and prioritizing them are perfect. I do love to continue using it if they update the notification part.
Nice app but can be improved upon in terms of navigating the app
loving it so far! keeps me motivated :)
"This app is so cool! It's geared towards complete configuration from the user, so give your goals the time they deserve and map it out. Once you get through learning the app, it will be an awesome tool for your future development!"
I've been using the app for a while and since last week it has been acting weird. I don't receive reminders anymore and it's completely a waste of time to set reminders! Not very reliable right now
"The program is very good on my old phone(galaxy note 4), but notifications don't work on the new one(redmi note 8 pro). I hope you will fix them. Thanks"
"I was about to jump wholeheartedly into using this app (its integration with Google Calendar being exactly what I'm looking for) but now I see that it has no search feature on Android. Worse still, Android Search has been on their roadmap since 2015 and it's still not done. 2015!?! In the meantime other apps can build smart lists it out of tags, status and free text. Seriously behind the curve, guys."
"I very rarely leave reviews, but I have to say this is the best ""to do"" app I've ever used in my life. I've even tried all the popular ones and they didn't work for me like this one does. The notifications are amazing and I love that I can snooze them."
Good interface and design. But the sharing capabilities were riddled with issues. The app became almost unusable if you tried to share anything
Nice one
Very simple setup and gives you an idea of where you have time in your daily schedule.
"Came from Wunderlist and, to no surprise, Microsoft has managed to cause issues. My wife and I create ""tasks"" as shopping lists and they take quite a bit longer to sync than they used to if they even sync at all."
"I signed up for the pro: $30/ year is on the bordreline for me, but i feel it is worth it if it can make me even 15% more organized or disciplibed. It has some very good features and flexibility: 1) Kanban view of projects sold me; 2) a nice habit maker capability, 3) plan my day feature where you go through the tasks of the day and either keep them or postpone them."
Super Kalender App
"useless, as you can not group habits, but gamifying idea is good, maybe they will fix it"
"I do not have much to say in regards to the app itself. It seems to function fine, but it was not the calendar app that I needed. The reason I am giving it 1 star is because I canceled my subscription and account within the seven day free trial and still got charged the yearly rate. The problem has been reported to the company. I will keep this review updated with any action from Any.Do. UPDATE: The gist of the problem is this. Any.do makes it very difficult to find out how to cancel the sub."
"I have the same recurring tasks to do every day. I need a to-do-list reminder to buzz me when it's time. The problem with this app, is that those reminder times somehow start drifting every day, giving me different times the next day! That is an annoying fail! Screw it, I'm going elsewhere. if I find a better app, I'll let you guys know. UPDATE : Suggestion did not work, and I found an app, that does not drift. I have moved on."
The app is only syncing my all-day events. All other events are not displaying.
Everything good simple and easy to use the best one but you dont get reminder as alarm so that you can actually know the schedule its just give a notification which can be easily ignored by mistake .....please fix this and link it up with alarm too just like you did with default calendar app
App seems ok. But they want you to pay a monthly fee just to use a basic calendar. It let's you view the current week. Anything else and you have to pay. So many free ones out there to choose from. Uninstalling.
"Of all the check list apps I've tried out, this one is the best organized, and it's customizable without being overly complicated."
"The app is great for organizing and planning, however the constantly crashing gets old really fast. Please fix this. Otherwise the app would be perfect!"
"Not a single event, appointment, meeting, etc...is showing up. going to uninstall after rating."
Nice app. it's just I feel their is always space for improvement.
"I love everything about this app, except for how it handles snoozing repeat tasks. It's easy to use and has a lot of configuration, something a lot of other apps save for the premium version. Unfortunately, I find it unusable due to how snoozing repeat tasks then alters the date/time for all future occurrences, making it difficult to manage these tasks when I just want to snooze it this one time. If this was changed I would give 5 stars and upgrade to premium as the app is otherwise perfect."
Pretty good calendar app. I like the layout of the Samsung calendar app a little better but this one has more features.
Best app to focus and study
"It's actually good but then stopped working effectively since a week ... suddenly it stops and I couldn't open it...so, had to uninstall and install many a times, I also lost all my productivity due to it's sudden shutdown...mine is a pro version too..this is so bad and testing our patience.. please fix the issue.! Thankyou."
Love the app only had for 2 days 👍
Great app stopping me from procrastinating... Actually getting things done 👍
"The app is really good, but after some time it keeps stopping! I reinstalled it two times and the third time also, the problem persists. I was forced to uninstall it finally."
"I was going to give 4 stars, but the app does something kinda sleazy where it asks you what you would rate it and only redirects you to Google play if you said five stars, so I lowered it to 2 stars."
"Great, but have some issues with the tasks list widget. No way I can complete a task on it without its disappearing"
Lack of personal themes. Not such pleasant view as it was in Wunderlist.
The most recent update just made it harder to move times around.
Just downloaded the app better review later on
"Updates made that are not fully tested. They need to add option to revert back to the olddd verison. that was simple to use, but most importantly it worked."
Hey i was very glad to use calendar 30 until now. I can not edit anything ... If i want to delete something is reappear every time. I can't move or delete. If is not working i want my money back. I will change the review if you solve this problem. Edit :I will edit the review after you ll solve this problem. I send it an email also.
Good.
Didn't make any sense to me. I started using this app and attempted to make a sceduale but couldn't figure it out.
"There are more effective, and honest, ways to turn a buck in the Playstore. Crippling your app with a paywall only drives home just how unnecessary the app is."
Overall it's a great app that I use every day but what I truly hate is I paid for the full version and since I have 3 Google accounts in my phone no matter what instructions I'm given by the developer it doesn't recognize I bought it because it defaults to the wrong account. If they fix and let me select correct amount I'll bump my rating back up. Should have an option. Sad
App s not opening...its vry hard to uninstal .. and instal again..plz fix tis prblm..otherwise app s too gud...
Ok but i hate big full screen ads with long videos
"Just I love it. I don't know this app. Once I open YouTube and see what is the best apps for student. And it tells 10 apps. But I can try only this app. So it will be very helpful, greatful, joyful and totally it suits me. It is very helpful for all. Your's, Deepika"
"I'm loving the User Interface of the app. Easy to use, simplified widget display, I don't think I even need the pro version. Perfect. Completely value adding."
"Extremely easy to use. Only thing I'm having troubles with is I have an event that I set for 15mins a week, everytime I try and tap that its comoleted it asks me to set the new rule instead of just marking complete."
No notification of Habit tracks
"Really beneficial, it allows me to follow my routines efficiently"
Lots of In-app purchases ... Not worth the time .
My favorite aspect of this app is the visual organization of my daily events! It's a great little widget for people who need to keep track of their life but literally always forget to open the calendar app. I would like to see more color custom options 😊
Worst app ever!!! During the import from Wonderlist it removed all of my data. Leave it to MS to screw up a great app.
"Really pretty good app; but two problems! 1. Sometimes repeat weekly reminders don't work at all, especially if you haven't ticked it the previous week! 2. Please allow multiple reminders for one event! Thanks, it's really promising and useful otherwise!"
Good
Good for those who read offline but not for those who have online studying platform.
"NEED MORE ×.WITH APP, SO FAR SOGOOD"
"Basic version works as described; just not what I need. The habits I want to improve require reminders at different times of day. And I'm personally not finding it an effective incentive, especially 'starting over' if missing one time. That's kind of a carrot AND stick approach. I'll stick to a simple checklist of what, & calendar/alarm clock to remind me when. Making this app's functions kind of ...basic and redundant? And since all apps use space... well, uninstalled. But the app works fine."
"This application is very helpful for me. Thanks ""Any.do"" for everything to remember me."
This app is crashing again and again and again. I've pro version still it keeps crashing every 2nd day. Please fix this it's damn irritating every 2nd day to get a fresh installation.
"I like it, also I would like, like a wedget but for the block screen. Then you don't need to open the phone, only activate the screen in order to see the next task in your calendar"
"There is too much WHITE everywhere. what happened to assigning colors to folders? Add some more theme colors like purple please. The latest update added color to the calendar widget for events, can you please give us the option to choose the colors? Also please bring back the old completion sound. Lowered rating because your Android Wear app hasn't been updated since 2015. Please fix to work with 2.0. I really love this app but may have to move on if it won't work on my watch."
Lately from past two days I am facing difficulty using widget. Getting an error 'task list not found' whenever I strike off a task. Please look into it ASAP.
It allows me to leave the app. I have a Techno phone. How do i fix this? Sleeptown works perfectly though.
Probably the best productivity app available for FREE! The app itself is easy to use and it's really easy to make a task/routine. Highly recommended.
"Happy with the App...but personally I had two issues which are if addressed, may provide sort of convienience to the users. 1. If any task is not completed and deleted by mistake it can't be undone that I felt inconvenient to write the task again. 2. If any task is being feeded and there also undo/redo options are not available"
"Just installed this yesterday. Loved it. Love the concept. Love the design. Too bad the free version can't have access to the calendar 😝 but otherwise, it's a great app. Am gonna give it a go for another few more weeks before deciding to commit to premium."
It was a good app until this most recent update now my widget doesn't work it's not syncing with my calendars I'm losing dates appointments
it's a nice app. it make my life displined
Good
Been using this app for for years now and I really love it and help me organize stuff/schedules.
"in primo luogo, adoro... voglio dire, una lista che mi faccia giocare ed avanzare di livello come in un rpg... non posso fare altro che adorare tanterrimo in secondo luogo: probabilmente esiste un modo per impostare orari per le attività (lezioni, cose così), altrimenti non avrebbe senso poter impostare un allarme, ma... hem... io non ho idea di come si faccia (help me please) cosa numero tre: ho provato a cercarne una versione adattabile per pc e non sembra esserci... sarebbe bellissimo se ci fosse e (magari) fosse sincronizzabile ultima cosa e poi la pianto: esiste un modo per creare traguardi composti da più traguardi? mi piacerebbe avere un megaobbiettivo laurea composto dei vari esami... o campagne composte di varie sessioni..."
"i cannt acces my account anymore since their ""password reset"" feature does not work. tried on my iphone, android oreo, web version. i don't receive any email to reset my password."
The user interfaceis not good enough. It is not that much understandable
"I like it. However, I can't seem to get the notification sounds to work. They used to."
I input my appointments and it does not ring loud enough or pop up to let me know that i have an appt.  I have the paid version.  Am i doing something wrong.  IF my appt is at 11:00 do i have to input at 12:00 to get it to ring before 11:  screwy lewy. I will change my comments and rating once i get this resolved.
The new version is so complicated loved the old one it was simple and easy and quick to use it was perfect
"Well I like the app and it truly helps me stay focused, combined with some time restriction methods it's good (although those ones are short times plus breaks), achievements are boring and not good enough, they try to make you pay for extra, but the app itself is not exciting enough to pay, the achievements are not really worth it and it's hard to unlock new trees even with pro version. No new campaigns are launched & collecting coins is not an easily achievable task, too hard to get new trees."
Such a great app. Helps to organize your day perfectly. Great features
"It's good but for some reason, it keeps switching around everything. And I can't seem to move them around, so I have to delete them and start again. A bit frustrating but has a great purpose."
New update causing app to freeze. Pls correct it immediately.
I love this app but recently it has been freezing every time i add a new task. It's updated and i even reinstalled it yet it is still happening.
I like the way this app looks. Helps me feel I'm achieving things!
"It ok, gets boring after a while"
After installing this app my phone received an increased amount of spam calls. After removing the app from my phone I received fewer spam calls. It might be a coincidence... But it might not be.
"Can't clean up old Alexa lists! We use this purely for the Alexa shopping list integration. However, early on it was very buggy, so we had to relink our Alexa account a number of times. And now we have like 4 or 5 old ""Alexa shopping list""s that we cannot delete! ""Alexa lists can not be modified with Any.do. You can do it from the Alexa app""... No, I can not, because it only deletes the working one!"
"Love it, bought premium. BUT needs an option to schedule reoccurring tasks like ""take mom shopping first Sunday of every month at 11am."""
It’s not that good as much as I thought before I downloaded it. It never sent me notifications or alarms. I missed my two events because of this. 😭😭
"A novel approach to timekeeping that totally works. Effective and elegant. The best face for my smartwatch. BUT for me personally, it is always upside-down on my wrist. Can a feature be added to allow it to be rotated 180°??"
"This app is completely unusable on my Note10+ The account creation is riddled with errors and when I finally get into the app, I can't click on any items or add a new item without the app instantly crashing. I was excited by the premise and motivated to start using it, but the experience was downright embarrassing. I'd love for a developer response here to acknowledge these problems and maybe offer some solutions."
I'm basically lazy. This has helped me get myself into a routine somewhat. Works like a charm. And stares right into my face everytime I open (the widget) so I don't miss a thing. Great work. 👍
"So close to being my dream todo app. It claims to support Start Times but actually doesn't. You can record the start and due time, but you can't then filter a list to only show a task that has in fact started; i.e. what can I work on NOW. For me this makes start times nothing more than a tag, that I can't interact with, which totally defeats the point."
Having trouble syncing on new device; says there is no internet connection but my connection is strong.
"Good app, but does not respect ""do not disturb"" mode and keeps waking me up every night. EDIT: the issue is fixed, giving the deserved 5 stars. EDIT2: this is not fixed, after all. Somehow this app not only not respects the do not disturb mode, but also manages to send notifications one hour after I fell asleep. Today it sounded around 4 am!!!"
좋아요
"Before this, l used Wunderlist solely for my do listn I used Workflowy for ongoing notes and events throughout the years. I ike this app, but if you don't get everything done yesterday's then My Day iwhen you wake up the next day, My Day is blank. Imagine making to do list on a posted note and the next morning it was blank? That's not saving me time. Don't know why they didn't put that in when developing the app."
"wish It would link to my calendar so I can create, edit and complete in one location....that would make it 5 stars"
Used it for 1 day. Then forgot to even open it as got into new habit. It kept showing notifications and I kept ignoring it. Not much productive for me but app design is good.
Good app but you need to pay a subscription to use it fully. There isn't an option to pay for the app outright which is a shame
Crashes at start.
Not at all use ... Its not remainding with alarming then whats is the use of remainder app... Its only alarming while we open the app... Not usefull at all
"Very easy to use, good"
"Doesn't offer too many options to notes and writing (listing, text fonts and sizes). Tools and resources are very simple and limited."
Alarm nahi he
Stop looking at users as cash cows. I will be uninstalling this and moving to a different app which is as good and does not nag. This is quite a good To Do app other than that it too often comes up with prompts to upgrade to the premium subscription-based version. Since when have customers disrespectfully/greedily been treated as cash cows. It used to be apps were$5 at most for a lifetime of use but now they are greedy and arrogant enough to want $5 or thereabouts per Month! I wud pay a one off
Tasks in All tasks group is frequently disappearing & reappearing so kindly fix that bug otherwise app is great
It was good now alatm sound of tasks is full but sound is low only this app i have seperate alarm volume and its full
No custom repeat frequency...
Not sure.
Good experience
"Once I tweaked it for GTD, this is by far the best app out there. Speedy, snappy features and performance in every platform, extremely flexible labels, categories, projects, whatever. Easy rescheduling, adding tasks in the moment and multiple ways to do almost everything . So slick."
"It's a great app, and it's fun and intuitive to use! But I do have one concern. Clear notifications button is not working as of the moment."
"Very good. When I find myself lost in life (very often) , I swipe my trembling thumb over to Todoist, and am instantly guided back upon the path of righteous order. My day is immediately placed upon terms in which i can fully structure and understand and from which point, seize with a newfound confidence. That, or I reschedule my tasks to the next day. 10/10 I am better for it."
"Its good. The only thing that is missing is the time inclusion. Like at what time a particular task is planned. If that can be added, it would be perfect. It would be like a personal calendar and activity planner together. I hope that can be added."
"I really like how easy it is to use, that it displays your progress in a neat and easy-to-track way, and gives you options for how to measure your success (yes/no per day, #of days per week, days you want to succeed and days you can 'cheat', etc). It's pretty satisfying to tap the little circle for a thing I did and see it turn green and link up with other days! Would definitely recommend."
"Widget unresponsive. Boy, I am incredibly unlikely. I am the ONLY one to ever experience this! It must just be me."
"It's ok. So this is what Wunderlist became, it's pretty similar, it's intuitive but it's lost features that made it not a suitable replacement. Specially the ability to export list which include hyperlinks in the notes (or anything in the notes) and no (official) add on for a browser like chrome. Deal breakers for me, moved to TickTick. Still miss Wunderlist :("
"Firstly, thanks for your quick responses back. I appreciate it. Ok, so can you explain how to do it and where that is on the app? Because there's no tutorial for that part. When I click on the other tabs that show the month stats and graph there's nothing indicating that the old schedule has been saved in an independent track and a new track created."
"When you start to reschedule things, the interface is very awkward moving times around. For example, moving everything forward or backward on the schedule is very un intuitive"
"I can't seem to think it so I lose my calendar after 3 months and all my appointments. Is also ridiculous amount of pop-up ads.. it would be better if forwarding dates, this could be 1 step. Sometimes it is, rarely"
"I like this app👍but my routine won't work and notifications won't make 
sounds and not appear on screen..."
The app does what it says across devices. Would love a feature to add colours to the list to sort them out as per urgency. Another feature could be to give formatting options for text for additional notes within a set task.
"App is nice! It works fine. I think it might just be better if it can give some rewards (maybe points or what) whenever you exceed your goals. I also do not understand some items in the app like the red translucent thing that goes on when you tap the dates the 2nd time and why it decreases % when red. Maybe you can make the app more user friendly. I also sometimes feel offended by being catcalled by the app notifications. I don't think it's appropriate. Still, it's a great app."
"Automatically shows the reminder Snackbar when I open other apps without me setting it up, what kind of violation is this??? Stop bugging your users unsolicitedly. Uninstalled"
Alarm doesn't work fine
"I bought the premium version of this app and it doesn't work. The reminder does not function, which basically renders the app useless. I emailed the support team and I haven't gotten any response or acknowledgement of receipt. I want a refund. What a waste of my money"
This app is great but one thing that bugs me is that it doesnt have the option to attach images to the tasks. You can comment images within a task but I just wish you could directly attach them so you could see it underneath a task rather than having to click on the task then go into comments.
After the update whenever I try o buy a new kind of tree the app closes I liked the app before but now i have losed my interest in it😒😒😒😒😒 Please fix this bug..
"Am a timetune paid user , been using for more than a month. This looks like another User Interface for just reminders. Nothing more than this . An average application"
"It seems like a good app but I haven't found a way to enable a permanent notification for quick task adding. Is it only possible? EDIT: No, I mean a permanent notification that works like your widget, allowing to quickly add new tasks without opening the app. SplenDO and Any. Do have this feature for instance."
Can't understand how it works
"Best and cleanest scheduling app I've found by far. It has it all: multiple schedules repeating on custom intervals, visually effective tags, comments visible on table and notifications, widget, statistics, events, dark theme. All without adding unnecessary noise. Using it is extremely intuitive. Doesn't lock any significant features behind premium wall, instead they're just extras that are nice to have (which is a rarity). But one thing that's missing is the ability to copy events/activities."
This is most probably the best reminder app in android. I am using it for last couple of years after trying so many apps. I just love the widgets and the ad-less experience. I use it daily to manage my work. The reminder pop up is really helpful. Thank you developers.
Very easy to use. Have all I need
The app doesn't notify me when the task is ready to do. Please fix it or tell me what to do. Only when runs the app tasks work.
"Very good job. A ""postpone"" option is needed. It's a priority I believe Also, would like option for completed habits to hide for the day, and option to edit categories names, icons and colours"
I wish there would be a widget on lockscreen
Seems pretty neat but i miss one feature thst is very important for me: be able to just hit start/stop for tasks thst needs to be done for at least x minutes per day. i dont check or remember time when i start doing something.
Good but have more levels
Great app
"Very user unfriendly with hardly any explanation regarding what the buttons do or the stats mean. Trying to edit tasks for each day will only let me invent new tasks, not pick from a list. Utterly confusing. Could have been so much easier."
"Seems good so far. I might rate it higher after using it for longer but the annoying pop up messages forced me to either say I didn't like it or rate it now... EDIT: to reply to the response. There was only the option to review now or say I didn't like it. I would have picked review later if that was there. EDIT 2: Thanks for taking my suggestion on board, I will update this review and rating once I have used the app more 👍"
"The new video ad is really annoying, it pops out, and no way to close it unless you close the entire app. It really interrupt when you want to add a few appointments to the calendar."
"It does the job I wanted, that is to ring alarm at the set time. However I am unable to clear the timeline! That is old ones. Couldn't get much help from their help center"
This is the best app I have seen in this whole universe it has all the features everyone should download this app 😗😗😗😗😙😙😙😙
"Can be smarter, but good."
"Great, simple app. Notifications can be better; they pop out irrespective of whether goal was achieved and thus are useless."
Does not have a recurring task feature. Useless for me.
Ads that completely take over your phone and have a forced timer so you can't exit out of them.
My calendar doesn't show up
Very happy with this calendar. Have been using it for years. Thank you.
Widget non responsive.. suddenly u want to tick one item. A whole lot of other items tht got clicked
Great Tool
Simple and practical
Love it
The App has a lot of functionality but what is the use of flagging your emails but you cannot open the email messages from Microsoft To Do directly in Outlook? It worked well in Wunderlist but since Wunderlist was transferred to Microsoft To Do it doesn't work anymore.
"Very effective. I would give 5 stars ,but writting space too little. Larger writting space will help much better."
"Used to be great, ads are now far too intrusive and unprofessional"
Felt more like i was wasting time instead of getting something done.
For anyone who wants to use this app: Devs stopped updating this in 2018. So they won't reply to your queries and/or issues. Look elsewhere...
Missing an important feature!!! They need to add the option to remind you every x minutes and x hours per day. It is a must for someone who has ADHD. I would definitely keep the upgrade if they can implement this feature.
"Edit (since I can't seem to respond to your comment): I have the feeling the fullscreen apps appear more often than once every 18 hours, although I admittedly am not sure about this. But the x icon only appears after a timer has run out, which is partially why they're so annoying. I do understand the need for ads, and that a lot of work is put into the app, and I appreciate all your hard work on it ;)"
Useless without pro.
That's a great app
"Authors: Please stop associating every extension with this app. It's annoying this pops up when I try to open a jar file. [Edit] This means that excluding certain very popular file extensions (svg, pdf, jpg) when a file is opened from the files app, business calendar opens. This means if I try to open a Bz2 file, a AndrOffice file (odt) or a Jar file (jar). It's strange for me that Open Office files wouldn't open in AndrOffice but instead Business calendar opens instead."
