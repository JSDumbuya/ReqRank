Relatively often because I visit my family in Jutland, should I include that? Now it has been a long time due to corona, but maybe once a year otherwise? Maybe there will be more with my derby team eventually. if I'm traveling with someone, how much it costs, when it's open, where it is in relation to my area, how to get there. If I was very good at planning I would probably think about how much you walk around a place, if you are in a museum for a long time, for example, your legs can really hurt at the end, so not then I would know that I should do some easy activities afterwards. Good question, I'm a bit against downloading apps for everything. I probably wouldn't do it unless, for example, I was traveling with a friend who recommended it and for some reason it made sense that we both had it. It should be very good, and offer something I can't find elsewhere.
