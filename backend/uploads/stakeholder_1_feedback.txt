I travel about once a year. Yes, I usually do that every time before I travel, so I try to investigate on the internet, for example, which restaurants I can visit, cafes, or something else exciting to do in that city. It is important that I can get there by public transport or by car if I have it there, where I am going, what else is important? That it is also affordable, I think, what I have to experience, see, or eat is at a price that my economy can handle, uhmm what else is important? I can't really think of anything else right now, but there may be other things, it was just the transport I was thinking of, and I would probably prefer to have something nearby for food and drink, uhmm besides that, I probably can't think of anything else. Anything related to flying and everything else, if there's anything I need to know beforehand, that's what I'm thinking about. What else could there be? I can't really think of anything else. Well, at least an overview of the cities in the country, the accommodations and hotels, the sights that one can experience, and the restaurants and cafes that one can visit. Oh, and I would like to be able to see transportation options, such as public transportation, if I were to go to a city where I had never been before, so I could get a good overview of what I could choose from.
